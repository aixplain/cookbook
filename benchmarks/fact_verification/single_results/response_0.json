In fact, it works well for many nonclassical propositional logics. Footnote 2. Below, we describe an outline of the construction of Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra for the case of intuitionistic logic.', 'The Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra of a theory in propositional logic is an algebraic (and order-theoretic) structure built out of its formulas (modulo provable equivalence) and connectives. It thus carries an algebraic structure that corresponds to the logic in question and is generally the free such structure generated by the axioms of the theory.', 'The operations in a Lindenbaum-Tarski algebra A are inherited from those in the underlying theory T.These typically include conjunction and disjunction, which are well-defined on the equivalence classes.
