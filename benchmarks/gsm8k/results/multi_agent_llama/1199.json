But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.
