        "output": "The expenditure of Joseph in May was $500. In June, his expenditure was $60 less. To calculate the total expenditure, we need to add Joseph's expenditure in May to his expenditure in June. The total expenditure is calculated as follows: joseph_expenditure_may = 500, joseph_expenditure_june = 440, total_expenditure = joseph_expenditure_may + joseph_expenditure_june. Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for the two months is $940. dollars, 940",
