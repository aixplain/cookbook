    "question": "Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?",

Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. How many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?",
        "output": "[Explanation: Dave bought a large pack of french fries and ate fourteen before a hungry seagull stole the pack out of his hand. When the seagull landed, he gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate. Then three pigeons bullied him away from the food, and each pigeon ate three fries. Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. To find the initial amount of french fries, we can start by expressing the amount of fries Dave ate as a Python variable and calculate the amount left after he ate. Then, we can express the amount of fries the seagull ate and calculate the amount left after the seagull ate. We can continue this process for the pigeons, raccoon, and ants, and finally solve for the initial amount of french fries., Unit: french fries, Final Answer: 54]",

Later, a raccoon stole two thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried off a final french fry, leaving five behind. To find the initial amount of french fries, we can start by expressing the amount of fries Dave ate as a Python variable and calculate the amount left after he ate. Then, we can express the amount of fries the seagull ate and calculate the amount left after the seagull ate. We can continue this process for the pigeons, raccoon, and ants, and finally solve for the initial amount of french fries., Unit: french fries, Final Answer: 54]",
