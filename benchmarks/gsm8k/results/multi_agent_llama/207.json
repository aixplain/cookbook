Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, how much does Joe's bag of candy weigh, in grams?",
        "output": "Joe's bag of Halloween candy has 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. If each chocolate bar weighs 40g, we can calculate the weight of each candied apple as 20g. Then, we can calculate the total weight of the chocolate bars as 1000g and the total weight of the candied apples as 1600g. Finally, we can add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to get the final answer.\n\nThe total weight of the candy is 2600 grams, grams, 2600",
