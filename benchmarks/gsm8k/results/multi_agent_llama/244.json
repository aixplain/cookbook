Billy took twice as many as Kyle.  Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, and then Colby took from Griffin 3 less than the number of fries that Kyle had taken.  If in the end Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give Griffin?",
        "output": "Ginger gave Griffin 20 more fries than he had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries. Griffin initially had 24 french fries. Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took 10 fries, and Colby took 2 fries. Griffin ended up with 27 fries. To find the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries Griffin had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries from the total number of fries Griffin ended up with. \n\nThe number of fries Griffin had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries is 7. The total number of fries Griffin ended up with is 27. Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 27 - 7 = 20.\n\nExplanation: Ginger gave Griffin 20 more fries than he had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries.\nUnit: fries\nFinal answer: 20",

Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took 10 fries, and Colby took 2 fries. Griffin ended up with 27 fries. To find the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to subtract the number of fries Griffin had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries from the total number of fries Griffin ended up with. \n\nThe number of fries Griffin had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries is 7. The total number of fries Griffin ended up with is 27. Therefore, the number of fries Ginger gave Griffin is 27 - 7 = 20.\n\nExplanation: Ginger gave Griffin 20 more fries than he had after Kyle, Billy, and Colby took their fries.\nUnit: fries\nFinal answer: 20",
