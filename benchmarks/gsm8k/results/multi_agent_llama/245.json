Given that the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, and the difference in the number of snails is 28, use the python_repl tool to calculate the total number of fish. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as 'x'. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2x. We know that the difference in the number of snails (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums (2x). So, we can set up the equation: 28 = 2 * 2x. Solve for x and then calculate the total number of fish (2x).
