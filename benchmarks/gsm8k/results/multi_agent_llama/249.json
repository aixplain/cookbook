On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?",
        "output": "[Explanation: The difference in calories consumed by Sue and her sister is calculated by first finding the individual calories consumed by each. Sue ate 46 cookies and her sister ate 18 cookies, with 1 cookie having 200 calories. The total calories consumed by Sue is 46 * 200 = 9200 calories and by her sister is 18 * 200 = 3600 calories. The difference in calories consumed is then calculated as the absolute difference between the two, which is |9200 - 3600| = 5600 calories., unit: calories, final answer as an integer: 5600]",
