Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50?",
        "output": "Marie ordered one chicken meal that costs $12, 5 packs of milk that costs $3 each, 4 apples that cost $1.50 each, and some boxes of pizza. Marie paid a total of $50. How many boxes of pizza did Marie order if each box costs $8.50? The total cost of the chicken meal, packs of milk, and apples is $12 + (5 * $3) + (4 * $1.50) = $12 + $15 + $6 = $33. The total cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17. The number of boxes is $17 / $8.50 = 2.0. Since we cannot order a fraction of a box, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza., boxes of pizza, 2",
