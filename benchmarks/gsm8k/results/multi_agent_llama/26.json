        "input": "Return the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer],Example: 3 apples minus 1 are 2 apples, apples, 2Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50. One pair of pants costs $22.50 and one pair of shoes costs $42. How many dollars did Mishka spend on all the clothing items?",
        "output": "To calculate the total cost of the shoes, we can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of one pair of shoes\nshoes_cost = 42\n\n# Define the number of pairs of shoes\nnum_shoes = 3\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the shoes\ntotal_shoes_cost = num_shoes * shoes_cost\n\n# Print the total cost of the shoes\nprint(total_shoes_cost)\n```\n\nThe total cost of the shoes is $126.\n\nNow, let's add the total costs of all clothing items together:\n\nTotal cost of shorts = $49.50\nTotal cost of pants = $67.50\nTotal cost of shoes = $126\n\nTotal cost of all clothing items = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243\n\nSo, Mishka spent $243 on all the clothing items.\n\n[Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]: Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes. One pair of shorts costs $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42. To find the total cost of all clothing items, we calculated the total cost of each item and added them together. The total cost of the shorts is $49.50, the total cost of the pants is $67.50, and the total cost of the shoes is $126. Therefore, the total cost of all clothing items is $243., dollars, 243",

One pair of shorts costs $16.50, one pair of pants costs $22.50, and one pair of shoes costs $42. To find the total cost of all clothing items, we calculated the total cost of each item and added them together. The total cost of the shorts is $49.50, the total cost of the pants is $67.50, and the total cost of the shoes is $126. Therefore, the total cost of all clothing items is $243., dollars, 243",
