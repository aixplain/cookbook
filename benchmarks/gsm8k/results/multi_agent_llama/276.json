To find the number of cards with the letter D, we first calculated the number of cards with the letter A, which is 32. Then we calculated the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A, which is 48. Next, we calculated the number of cards with the letter B, which is 24. After that, we calculated the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letters A and B, which is 24. Then we calculated the number of cards with the letter C, which is 15. Finally, we calculated the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letters A, B, and C, which is 9. Since the remaining cards had the letter D, the number of cards with the letter D is 9. \ncards with the letter D, 9",

Then we calculated the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letter A, which is 48. Next, we calculated the number of cards with the letter B, which is 24. After that, we calculated the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letters A and B, which is 24. Then we calculated the number of cards with the letter C, which is 15. Finally, we calculated the number of cards remaining after removing the cards with the letters A, B, and C, which is 9.
