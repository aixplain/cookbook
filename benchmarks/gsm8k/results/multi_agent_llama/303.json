So, the total number of books sold in the current year is 250 - 50 = 200, and the number of books sold this year is 45. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, we can calculate the number of books sold in the first year as 2 * (200 - 45) = 2 * 155 = 310.
