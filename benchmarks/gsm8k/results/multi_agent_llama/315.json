You can use this information to calculate the total number of people who show up for Martha's party.\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of people invited\ntotal_people_invited = 24\n\n# Define the total number of people who didn't show up\ntotal_people_didnt_show_up = 10\n\n# Calculate the total number of people who show up for Martha's party\ntotal_people_show_up = total_people_invited - total_people_didnt_show_up\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_people_show_up)\n```')",
