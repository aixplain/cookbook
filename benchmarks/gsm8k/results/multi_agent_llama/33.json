        "output": "[\"Gretchen has 70 gold coins because there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins and the total number of coins is 110. This can be represented by the equation G + S = 110, where G is the number of gold coins and S is the number of silver coins. Since G = S + 30, we can substitute this into the equation to get S + 30 + S = 110. This simplifies to 2S + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides gives 2S = 80. Dividing both sides by 2 gives S = 40. Since G = S + 30, we can substitute this value of S into the equation to get G = 40 + 30. This simplifies to G = 70.\", \"gold coins\", 70]",
