At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits.  Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits.  How many outfits does she have for her baby?",
        "output": "[Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. At her baby shower, Laurel received twice the amount of new baby outfits, which is 48. Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. Calculate the total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby by adding these numbers together and return the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. For example, you can use the following python code to calculate the total number of outfits and format the answer:\n\n```python\nfriend_outfits = 24  # number of outfits Laurel's friend gave her\nnew_outfits = 48  # number of new outfits Laurel received at her baby shower\nmom_outfits = 15  # number of outfits Laurel's mom gifted her\ntotal_outfits = friend_outfits + new_outfits + mom_outfits\nexplanation = f\"{friend_outfits} baby outfits plus {new_outfits} baby outfits plus {mom_outfits} baby outfits are\"\nunit = \"baby outfits\"\nfinal_answer = total_outfits\nprint(f\"[\\\"{explanation}\\\", \\\"{unit}\\\", {final_answer}]\")\n```\n\nThe total number of outfits Laurel has for her baby is 87. \n\nThe final answer is [24 baby outfits plus 48 baby outfits plus 15 baby outfits are, baby outfits, 87].",
