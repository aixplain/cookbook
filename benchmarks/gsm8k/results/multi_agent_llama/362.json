To find the total amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds, we need to calculate the amount of stuffing needed for each type of bed and then add them together.\n\nFirst, we calculate the average amount of stuffing needed for a collie bed, which is (8 + 2) / 2 = 5 pounds.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount of stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds, which is 4 * 2 = 8 pounds.\n\nThen, we calculate the amount of stuffing needed for 3 collie beds, which is 3 * 5 = 15 pounds.\n\nFinally, we add the amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds together to get the total amount of stuffing needed, which is 8 + 15 = 23 pounds.\n\nThe total amount of stuffing needed is 23 pounds of stuffing, pounds, 23.",
