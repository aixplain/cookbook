To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu and add it to the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson. \n\nThe number of messages James delivers to Mr. Yu is 1/3 of the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson, which is 66 / 3 = 22 messages. \n\nThe total number of messages James delivers is 66 + 22 = 88 messages.\n\nmessages, 88",
