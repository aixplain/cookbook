        "output": "To determine the number of days Mark has to save his money to buy a bike that costs $300, we need to calculate the amount he still needs to save and then divide that by his daily earnings.\n\nExplanation: Mark has $50 in his bank account and earns $10 per day. The bike costs $300, so he still needs to save $300 - $50 = $250. To find out how many days he needs to save, we divide the amount he still needs to save ($250) by his daily earnings ($10).\n\nUnit: days\nFinal answer: 25",
