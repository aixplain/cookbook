    "question": "Tyson decided to make muffaletta sandwiches for the big game.  Each sandwich required 1 pound each of meat and cheese and would serve 4 people.  There would be 20 people in total watching the game.  The meat cost $7.00 per pound and the cheese cost $3.00 per pound.  How much money would he spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people?",

        "output": "To determine the amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, we need to calculate the total cost of the meat and cheese required. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, and there are 20 people to serve. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, we need 5 sandwiches. The total amount of meat required is 5 pounds, and the total amount of cheese required is also 5 pounds. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost of the meat and cheese is $50.00.\n\nTyson would spend this much money on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people, dollars, 50.",
