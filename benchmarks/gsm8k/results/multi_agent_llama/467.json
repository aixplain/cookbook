Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. How many pieces of laundry are there in 80 rooms?",
        "output": "To find the total number of laundry pieces in 80 rooms, we need to calculate the total number of sheets, comforters, pillow cases, and towels in each room and then multiply by the number of rooms.\n\nExplanation: \nEach room has 2 sheets, 1 comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets (2 * 2 = 4), and twice as many towels as pillow cases (4 * 2 = 8). \nSo, the total number of laundry pieces in each room is 2 + 1 + 4 + 8 = 15. \nHowever, we already know the total number of sheets is 160, the total number of comforters is 80, the total number of pillow cases is 320, and the total number of towels is 640. \nSo, the total number of laundry pieces in each room is 160 + 80 + 320 + 640 = 1200. \nBut this is the total for all rooms, not per room. \nSince we know the total number of laundry pieces in each room is actually 15, we can calculate the total number of laundry pieces in 80 rooms by multiplying 15 by 80.\n\nUnit: pieces of laundry\nFinal answer: 1200",
