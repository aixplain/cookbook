    "question": "Mark is trying to choose between two venues for a surprise party for his wife.  The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of how many guests attend.  While the second charges, $25 per person who attends.  However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?",

        "output": "To find the number of guests where the costs are equal, we need to solve the equation 150 + 10 * x = 20 * x + 50. \n\nExplanation: To solve this equation, we need to isolate x. First, we can simplify the equation by combining like terms. We can subtract 10 * x from both sides of the equation to get 150 = 10 * x + 50. Then, we can subtract 50 from both sides to get 100 = 10 * x. Finally, we can divide both sides by 10 to get x = 10.\n\nunit: guests\nfinal answer as an integer: 10",
