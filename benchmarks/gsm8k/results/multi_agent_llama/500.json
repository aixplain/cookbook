        "output": "[Explanation: To calculate the number of insects Lily found, we need to substitute x into the expression x/2 + 7. We know that x is 18, which represents the number of insects Bodhi found. David found half of what Bodhi found, so David found 18/2 = 9 insects. Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can calculate the number of insects Lily found by adding 7 to David's total., unit: insects, final answer as an integer: 16]",
