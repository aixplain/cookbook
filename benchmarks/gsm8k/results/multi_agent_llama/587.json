        "output": "The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is calculated by subtracting the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans. The number of green jelly beans is 1515 and the number of red jelly beans is 1485. Subtracting the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans gives 1515 - 1485 = 30. Therefore, the difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is 30 jelly beans.\n\nExplanation: The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is calculated by subtracting the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans.\nunit: jelly beans\nfinal answer as an integer: 30",
