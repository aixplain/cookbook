    "question": "Bill is ordering a new truck. He has decided to purchase a two-ton truck with several added features: a king cab upgrade, a towing package, leather seats, running boards, and the upgraded exterior light package.  The base price of the truck is $30,000, and the other features are at extra cost. The king cab is an extra $7,500, leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, and the upgraded exterior light package is $1500.  What is the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars?",
