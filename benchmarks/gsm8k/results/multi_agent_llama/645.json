        "output": "[The total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is 48 kilograms. The explanation is that the bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, so the amount of flour in one bag is 16 kilograms. Multiplying this amount by 3 gives the total amount of flour in three bags. The unit is kilograms and the final answer is 48.]",
