Calculate the number of bucks in the field and the number of 8-point bucks in the field. Then, return the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. Use the given percentages to calculate the number of bucks and 8-point bucks. For example, if there are 50 deer and 50 percent of them are bucks, you can calculate the number of bucks as 50 * 0.5 = 25. Similarly, if 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, you can calculate the number of 8-point bucks as 25 * 0.2 = 5. Use this information to provide the final answer in the required format.')",
