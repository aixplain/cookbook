        "output": "The company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. To calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices, we first calculated the price increase for each computer, which was $70.0. Then, we calculated the new price for each computer by adding this price increase to the original price, resulting in a new price of $770.0. Finally, we calculated the total amount paid for all computers by multiplying the new price by the number of computers. \n\ndollars, 385000",
