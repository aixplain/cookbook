She ate 2 slices and while she was distracted, her friend stole 5 slices off her plate. Mara initially had 2 slices, then added 3 slices to get 5 slices. She tripled the number of slices to get 15 slices. Mara ate 2 slices, resulting in 13 slices. Mara's friend stole 5 slices, resulting in 8 slices. However, the correct calculation is 13 - 5 = 8. \n\nThe correct explanation is: 13 cake slices minus 5 cake slices are 8 cake slices, cake slices, 8",
