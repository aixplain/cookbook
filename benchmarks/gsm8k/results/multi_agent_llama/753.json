        "output": "Jeff had 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates initially. 8 dozen glasses is 96 glasses and 4 dozen plates is 48 plates.  After the party, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.  So Jeff has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates now. Since Jeff has two items, the answer cannot be returned as a single integer in the requested format. However, the correct format for the answer would be 'Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates initially.  After the party, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.

After the party, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.  So Jeff has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates now. Since Jeff has two items, the answer cannot be returned as a single integer in the requested format. However, the correct format for the answer would be 'Jeff had 96 glasses and 48 plates initially.  After the party, 10 glasses and 6 plates were broken.  So Jeff has 96 - 10 = 86 glasses and 48 - 6 = 42 plates now, glasses and plates, 86 and 42'.",
