Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?\n\nExplanation: To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students who need each size and add them up. \nFirst, we calculate the number of students who need size small shirts, which is twice the number of students who need size extra-small shirts. \nThen, we calculate the number of students who need size medium shirts, which is four less than the number of students who need size small shirts. \nNext, we calculate the number of students who need size large shirts, which is half the number of students who need size medium shirts. \nAfter that, we calculate the number of students who need size extra-large shirts, which is six more than the number of students who need size large shirts. \nFinally, we add up the number of students who need each size to get the total number of shirts ordered.\n\nUnit: shirts\n\nFinal Answer: 75",

                "output": "Krissa needs to order field trip shirts for her preschool students. 11 students need size extra-small. Twice as many students need size small as extra small. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Half as many students need size large as size medium. Six more students need size extra-large than large. Altogether, how many shirts did Krissa order?\n\nExplanation: To find the total number of shirts ordered, we need to calculate the number of students who need each size and add them up. \nFirst, we calculate the number of students who need size small shirts, which is twice the number of students who need size extra-small shirts. \nThen, we calculate the number of students who need size medium shirts, which is four less than the number of students who need size small shirts. \nNext, we calculate the number of students who need size large shirts, which is half the number of students who need size medium shirts. \nAfter that, we calculate the number of students who need size extra-large shirts, which is six more than the number of students who need size large shirts. \nFinally, we add up the number of students who need each size to get the total number of shirts ordered.\n\nUnit: shirts\n\nFinal Answer: 75",
