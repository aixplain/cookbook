    "question": "John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?",

        "output": "[Explanation: To calculate the final distance from home, we subtract the total distance John covers during the 4 hours from the distance he was from home initially. Since John was 180 miles away from home initially and he covers a total distance of 150 miles during the 4 hours, the final distance from home is 180 - 150 = 30 miles. However, this is the distance he is closer to home, so the distance he is from home is 180 - 30 = 150 miles, unit: miles, 30]",
