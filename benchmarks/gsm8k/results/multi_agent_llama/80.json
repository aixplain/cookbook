        "output": "The amount of water the girls and the boy got is the difference between the initial amount of water and the amount of water left. Calculation: 24 - 10 = 14. However, we know that the girls and the boy got 14.0 liters of water. Since the final answer should be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer. Final Answer: 10, liters, 10",
