                "output": "Python Code Executor(input=''Tanya makes a salt scrub from salt, oil, fragrance, citrus zest, and sugar. She makes enough to fill a 10-ounce jar each time. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance and the same amount of salt as sugar. She uses twice as much oil as salt and twice as much salt as zest. Let's denote the amount of citrus zest as x. Then the amount of fragrance is also x, the amount of salt is 2x, the amount of sugar is 2x, and the amount of oil is 4x. We have already found that x = 1. Now, we can find the amount of oil by multiplying x by 4. Please express this relationship in Python code and calculate the amount of oil. Then, return the answer as [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. \n\nHere is a sample code to get you started:\n```python\n# Define the value of x\nx = 1  \n\n# Express the relationship between x and oil in Python code\noil = 4 * x  \n\n# Print the value of oil\nprint(\"The amount of oil is:\", oil)\n\n# Return the answer as [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\nprint(\"Tanya uses\", oil, \"ounces of oil to make a salt scrub, so she uses\", oil, \"ounces of oil.\")\nprint(\"ounces\")\nprint(int(oil))\n```'')",
