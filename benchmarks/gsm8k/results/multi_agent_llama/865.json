        "output": "[Explanation: To find the number of yellow cars, we need to subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars in the rink. We already know that the rink has 10 green cars and 30 blue cars and the total number of red, green, and blue cars is 52. Since the rink has 12 red cars, 10 green cars, and 30 blue cars, the total number of red, green, and blue cars is indeed 52. So, the number of yellow cars is 75 - 52 = 23., unit: cars, final answer as an integer: 23]",
