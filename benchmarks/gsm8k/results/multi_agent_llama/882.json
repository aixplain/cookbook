    "question": "Kelly is grocery shopping at a supermarket and is making sure she has enough in her budget for the items in her cart. Her 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total and she has 6 packets of chicken which each cost twice as much as a pack of bacon. She also has 3 packs of strawberries, priced at $4 each, and 7 packs of apples, each priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries. If Kelly\u2019s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?",

If Kelly\u2019s budget is $65 then how much money, in dollars, does she have left in her budget?\n\nExplanation: The total cost of all items is $338.0, which exceeds Kelly's budget of $65.
