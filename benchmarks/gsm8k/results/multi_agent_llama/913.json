He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.  If Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons, and twenty of the balloons were red, then how many of the balloons in the bundle were yellow?",
        "output": "Benny threw 58 pieces of bologna at a bundle of red and yellow balloons. He threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon and three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon. The total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 40, and the total number of bologna pieces thrown at all balloons is 58. The difference between the total number of bologna pieces thrown and the total number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons is 18. This difference is the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons. Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, the number of yellow balloons is 18 / 3 = 6, balloons, 6",
