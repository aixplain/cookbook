        "output": "[Explanation: The total cost of gas after cashback rewards is calculated by first finding the total cost before cashback rewards, then subtracting the cashback amount. The total cost before cashback rewards is $3.00 per gallon multiplied by 10 gallons, which is $30.00. The cashback amount is $0.20 per gallon multiplied by 10 gallons, which is $2.00. Therefore, the total cost after cashback rewards is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00, unit: cents, final answer as an integer: 2800]",
