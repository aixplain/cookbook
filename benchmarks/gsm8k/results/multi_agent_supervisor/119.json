We know Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000 and it was 30% higher than Lylah's. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was $40000 / 1.3. Four years later, Adrien's salary had increased by 40% compared to what he was making four years ago. Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, we can calculate their salaries four years later. The total salary they were receiving four years later is the sum of their individual salaries., unit: dollars, final answer as an integer: 99076]",
