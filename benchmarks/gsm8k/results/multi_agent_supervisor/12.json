However, the return statement in the function is incorrect. It should be a simple string with the number of years. Here is the corrected code: \n```python\ndef calculate_years():\n    initial_cost = 90\n    annual_profit = 7 * 1.5 - 3\n    years = 0\n    total_profit = 0\n\n    while total_profit < initial_cost:\n        total_profit += annual_profit\n        years += 1\n\n    return f'It will take Carlos {years} years to start earning money on the lemon tree.'\n\nprint(calculate_years())\n```\nThe response to the last comment is that the code needs to be corrected to provide the accurate number of years.",
