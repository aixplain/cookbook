    "question": "Debra is monitoring a beehive to see how many bees come and go in a day. She sees 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, and then she sees 1/2 that many bees return in the next 6 hours. She sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Then every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees did Debra see return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?",
