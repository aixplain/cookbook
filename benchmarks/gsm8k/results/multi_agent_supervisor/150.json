    "question": "Steve and Tim decide to see who can get home from school the fastest. Steve lives further away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride his bike.

If Tim can ride his skateboard at 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at their house before the loser finishes the race?",
