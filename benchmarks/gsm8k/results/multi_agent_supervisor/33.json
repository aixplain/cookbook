        "output": "Gretchen has 110 coins. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. To find the number of gold coins, we need to find the number of silver coins first. Let's solve the equation x + (x + 30) = 110 to find the number of silver coins. Then, we can calculate the number of gold coins by adding 30 to the number of silver coins. The solution is 40 gold coins, gold coins, 40",

It first defines an equation x + (x + 30) = 110, then solves for x by iterating through possible values until it finds the solution. After finding the number of silver coins, it calculates the number of gold coins by adding 30 to the number of silver coins. The code then prints the result.",
