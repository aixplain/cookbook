Please write a python code to calculate the final answer and return it as [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. \n\nExample: \n3 apples minus 1 are 2 apples, apples, 2 \n\nPlease use the following calculation method:\n- Calculate the total value of the pension she is entitled to after 20 years: 20 years * $50,000/year = $1,000,000\n- Calculate the additional value she is entitled to for the next 10 years: 10 years * 5% of $50,000/year = 10 years * $2,500/year = $25,000\n- Calculate the total annual pension after 30 years: $1,000,000 + $25,000 = $1,025,000 / 30 years = $34,166.67\n\nHowever, since she only worked for 30 years, she will only get 30/40 of the full pension.
