        "output": "[Bailey started with an initial amount of money. She received a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks. At the end of the 8 weeks, if she has a total of $100, we can calculate the initial amount of money Bailey had before receiving her weekly allowance. The total allowance she received is 5 * 8 = 40 dollars. The total amount she had at the end of 8 weeks is 100 dollars. So, we can write the equation as x + 40 = 100. Solving for x, we get x = 100 - 40 = 60. So Bailey started with $60, dollars, 60]",
