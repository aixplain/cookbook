However, the problem statement has been changed to 5 dance classes. Please provide the total amount of money as an integer (in cents) and include the unit and explanation in the output. For example, if the total amount is $1200, the output should be: [\"Judy makes this much money in 1 week\", \"dollars\", 1200]. Use the following python code to calculate the total amount of money:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nclasses_on_weekdays = 5\nclasses_on_saturday = 8\nstudents_per_class = 15\ncharge_per_student = 15.00  # in dollars\n\n# Calculate total classes\ntotal_classes = classes_on_weekdays * 5 + classes_on_saturday\n\n# Calculate total students\ntotal_students = total_classes * students_per_class\n\n# Calculate total amount of money\ntotal_amount = total_students * charge_per_student\n\n# Convert total amount to cents\ntotal_amount_cents = int(total_amount * 100)\n\n# Print the result\nprint([\"Judy makes this much money in 1 week\", \"dollars\", total_amount_cents])\n```')",
