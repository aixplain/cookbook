    "question": "John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?",

He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours? \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the distance John traveled during the 4 hours it took him to try to get home. We know that distance equals speed multiplied by time. We have three different speeds and times, so we'll need to calculate the distance for each segment and add them together.\n\nPlease write a Python code to calculate the distance John traveled during the 4 hours it took him to try to get home. \n\nDefine the variables:\n- speed1 = 60 mph (initial speed)\n- time1 = 3 hours (initial time)\n- speed2 = 0 mph (speed in standstill traffic)\n- time2 = 2 hours (time in standstill traffic)\n- speed3 = 30 mph (speed after standstill traffic)\n- time3 = 0.5 hours (time after standstill traffic)\n- speed4 = 80 mph (final speed)\n- time4 = 1.5 hours (final time)\n\nCalculate the distance for each segment and add them together. Then, subtract the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours from the total distance to get the final answer. \n\nFinally, return the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]. For example: 'John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.', 'miles', 45\"')",
