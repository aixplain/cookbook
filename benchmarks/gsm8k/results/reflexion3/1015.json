So, the total number of sweets in the box is 15 * 60. \n\nAnne kept 2 packs for herself, which is 2 * 60 sweets. \n\nThe total number of sweets she gave to her friends is the total number of sweets in the box minus the number of sweets she kept. \n\nUse the python_repl tool to calculate this. \n\nHere is the python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of packs and pieces per pack\ntotal_packs = 15\npieces_per_pack = 60\n\n# Calculate the total number of sweets in the box\ntotal_sweets = total_packs * pieces_per_pack\n\n# Calculate the number of sweets Anne kept\nsweets_kept = 2 * pieces_per_pack\n\n# Calculate the total number of sweets Anne gave to her friends\nsweets_given = total_sweets - sweets_kept\n\nprint(sweets_given)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of sweets Anne gave to her friends is 780.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are assigned to calculate the number of sweets each of Anne's friends received.\n\nTo do this, you need to know the total number of sweets Anne gave to her friends and the number of friends she gave them to.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated that Anne gave a total of 780 sweets to her friends.\n\nWe also know that Anne has 10 friends.\n\nTo calculate the number of sweets each friend received, we need to divide the total number of sweets given by the number of friends.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to calculate this.\n\nHere is the python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of sweets given and the number of friends\ntotal_sweets_given = 780\nnumber_of_friends = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of sweets each friend received\nsweets_per_friend = total_sweets_given // number_of_friends\n\nprint(sweets_per_friend)\n```\n\nPlease execute this command and provide the result.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Anne gave 78 sweets to each of her friends.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are assigned to return the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer.\n\nTo do this, you need to know the number of sweets each of Anne's friends received and the unit of the sweets.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated that Anne gave 78 sweets to each of her friends.\n\nThe unit of the sweets is \"sweets\" or \"pieces\".\n\nUse the python_repl tool to return the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer.\n\nHere is the python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sweets each friend received and the unit\nsweets_per_friend = 78\nunit = \"sweets\"\n\n# Return the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer\nexplanation = f\"Anne gave {sweets_per_friend} sweets to each of her friends.\"\nfinal_answer = sweets_per_friend\n\nprint(f\"[\\\"{explanation}\\\", \\\"{unit}\\\", {final_answer}]\")\n```\n\nPlease execute this command and provide the result.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Anne gave 78 sweets to each of her friends.
