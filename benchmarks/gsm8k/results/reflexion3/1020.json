According to the problem, John picked 4 bananas on Wednesday.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to assign the number of bananas John picked on Wednesday to a variable. \n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nwednesday_bananas = 4\nprint(wednesday_bananas)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of bananas John picked on Wednesday is 4.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where John picks bananas on three different days. We need to calculate the total number of bananas John has.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated the number of bananas John picked on Wednesday. The result was:\n\nwednesday_bananas = 4\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Thursday. According to the problem, John picked 6 bananas on Thursday.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to assign the number of bananas John picked on Thursday to a variable. Please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nthursday_bananas = 6\nprint(thursday_bananas)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of bananas John picked on Thursday is 6.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where John picks bananas on three different days. We need to calculate the total number of bananas John has.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the number of bananas John picked on Wednesday and Thursday. The results were:\n\nwednesday_bananas = 4\nthursday_bananas = 6\n\nNow, we need to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday. According to the problem, John picked triple the number of bananas he did on Wednesday. \n\nUse the python_repl tool to calculate the number of bananas John picked on Friday by multiplying the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday by 3. Please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nfriday_bananas = wednesday_bananas * 3\nprint(friday_bananas)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of bananas John picked on Friday is 12.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where John picks bananas on three different days. We need to calculate the total number of bananas John has.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the number of bananas John picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. The results were:\n\nwednesday_bananas = 4\nthursday_bananas = 6\nfriday_bananas = 12\n\nNow, we need to calculate the total number of bananas John has by adding the number of bananas he picked on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to calculate the total number of bananas John has. Please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\ntotal_bananas = wednesday_bananas + thursday_bananas + friday_bananas\nprint(total_bananas)\n```\n\nAlso, please provide the explanation and unit for the answer. The explanation should be in the format \"John picked a total of x bananas on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Therefore, John has x bananas.\" where x is the total number of bananas. The unit should be \"bananas\". \n\nPlease provide the final answer in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'John picked a total of 22 bananas on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Therefore, John has 22 bananas., bananas, 22'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
