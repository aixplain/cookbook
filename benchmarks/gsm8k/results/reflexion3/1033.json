We need to calculate her net earnings per hour.\n\nWe have already calculated her total earnings and total expenses in the previous steps. Now, we need to subtract her total expenses from her total earnings to get her net earnings. Then, we need to divide her net earnings by the total number of hours she worked to get her net earnings per hour.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_earnings = 36  # in dollars\ntotal_expenses = 9  # in dollars\nhours_per_day = 6\ndays_worked = 3\n\n# Calculate total hours worked\ntotal_hours_worked = hours_per_day * days_worked\n\n# Calculate net earnings\nnet_earnings = total_earnings - total_expenses\n\n# Calculate net earnings per hour\nnet_earnings_per_hour = net_earnings / total_hours_worked\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and final answer\nprint(\"Melissa's net earnings per hour are\", net_earnings_per_hour, \"dollars per hour, dollars per hour, \", int(net_earnings_per_hour))\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Melissa's net earnings per hour are 1.5 dollars per hour.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Melissa spends 6 hours a day for 3 days listening to a court case.
