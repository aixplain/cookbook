The second person took $80 more than the first person, and the third person took twice what the second person took. We need to calculate the share of the first person.\n\nLet's denote the share of the first person as x. Then, the share of the second person is x + 80, and the share of the third person is 2(x + 80).\n\nWe know that the total amount is $1920, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920\n\nCombine like terms and simplify the equation.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to define and simplify the equation. \n\nPlease execute the following python code:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, Eq, solve\n\n# Define the variable\nx = symbols('x')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = Eq(x + (x + 80) + 2*(x + 80), 1920)\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = solve(equation, x)\n\nprint(\"The share of the first person is\", solution[0], \"dollars.\")\nprint(\"The unit is dollars.\")\nprint(\"The final answer is\", solution[0])\n```\n\nThis will give us the solution to the equation based on the given information. Please provide the output of the python code, which is the solution to the equation in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The share of the first person is 420 dollars.
