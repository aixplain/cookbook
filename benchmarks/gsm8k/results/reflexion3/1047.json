We need to solve for x.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the task to solve the equation (x + 4) + x + x / 2 = 19 for x.\n\nIn the previous step, we set up the equation using the python_repl tool. However, the code did not solve for x. We need to modify the code to solve for x.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to solve the equation for x. You can use the sympy library in Python to solve the equation.\n\nHere is the code to get you started:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable x\nx = sp.symbols('x')\n\n# Set up the equation\nequation = (x + 4) + x + x / 2 - 19\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nsolution = sp.solve(equation, x)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"Solution: \", solution)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output. The output should be the value of x, which represents the number of balls retrieved in the second set. We will then use this value to find the number of balls retrieved in the first set.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The solution to the equation (x + 4) + x + x / 2 = 19 for x is 6.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the task to calculate the number of balls retrieved in the first set by adding 4 to x.\n\nIn the previous steps, we set up the equation (x + 4) + x + x / 2 = 19 and solved for x. The solution to the equation is x = 6, which represents the number of balls retrieved in the second set.\n\nTo find the number of balls retrieved in the first set, we need to add 4 to x.
