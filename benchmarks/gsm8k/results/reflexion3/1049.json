Half of them are written in English, and 10% in German. All others are written in Spanish. We need to calculate the number of books written in English.\n\nTo do this, we can use simple arithmetic operations. Since half of the books are written in English, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of books by 0.5.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of books\ntotal_books = 50\n\n# Calculate the number of books written in English\nenglish_books = total_books * 0.5\n\n# Print the result\nprint(english_books)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of books written in English.
