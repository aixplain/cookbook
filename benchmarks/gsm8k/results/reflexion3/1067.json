We know that he wants to send out 700 small coupons.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the number of big coupons by multiplying the number of small coupons by 2. \n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nsmall_coupons = 700\nbig_coupons = small_coupons * 2\nprint(big_coupons)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of big coupons. We will use this value in the next step to calculate the total postage cost.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of big coupons Anthony wants to send out is 1400.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons. According to the problem, each small coupon costs 5 cents to mail. We know that Anthony wants to send out 700 small coupons.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the cost of mailing the small coupons by multiplying the number of small coupons by the cost per small coupon.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nsmall_coupons = 700\ncost_per_small_coupon = 5  # in cents\ncost_of_mailing_small_coupons = small_coupons * cost_per_small_coupon\nprint(cost_of_mailing_small_coupons)\n```\n\nThis will give us the cost of mailing the small coupons in cents. We will use this value in the next step to calculate the total postage cost.\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that we already know the number of big coupons from the previous step, which is 1400. We will use this value in the next steps to calculate the total postage cost.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The cost of mailing the small coupons is 3500 cents.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons. According to the problem, each big coupon costs 15 cents to mail. We know that Anthony wants to send out 1400 big coupons, which we calculated in the previous step.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the cost of mailing the big coupons by multiplying the number of big coupons by the cost per big coupon.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nbig_coupons = 1400\ncost_per_big_coupon = 15  # in cents\ncost_of_mailing_big_coupons = big_coupons * cost_per_big_coupon\nprint(cost_of_mailing_big_coupons)\n```\n\nThis will give us the cost of mailing the big coupons in cents. We will use this value in the next step to calculate the total postage cost.\n\nNote: Please keep in mind that we already know the cost of mailing the small coupons from the previous step, which is 3500 cents. We will use this value in the next steps to calculate the total postage cost.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The cost of mailing the big coupons is 21000 cents.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the total cost of mailing the coupons. According to the problem, we know the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons.\n\nWe calculated in the previous steps that the cost of mailing the small coupons is 3500 cents and the cost of mailing the big coupons is 21000 cents.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the total cost of mailing the coupons by adding the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons.\n\nThen, convert the total cost from cents to dollars by dividing by 100.\n\nFinally, return the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\ncost_of_mailing_small_coupons = 3500  # in cents\ncost_of_mailing_big_coupons = 21000  # in cents\ntotal_cost_in_cents = cost_of_mailing_small_coupons + cost_of_mailing_big_coupons\ntotal_cost_in_dollars = total_cost_in_cents / 100\nprint(\"The total cost of mailing the coupons is\", total_cost_in_dollars, \"dollars.\")\nprint(\"dollars\")\nprint(int(total_cost_in_dollars))\n```\n\nThis will give us the total cost of mailing the coupons in dollars.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total cost of mailing the coupons is $245 dollars.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 5:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the total cost of mailing the coupons and return the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer.\n\nAccording to the problem, we know the cost of mailing the small coupons and the cost of mailing the big coupons.
