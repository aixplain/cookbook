On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. On Thursday, he finished homework early and watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show. On Friday, he got to stay up late for the weekend, so he watched two 1-hour episodes.

Since Frankie watched a 1-hour episode on each of these days, we can simply add 1 hour + 1 hour.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the hours watched on Monday and Tuesday\nmonday_hours = 1\ntuesday_hours = 1\n\n# Calculate the total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday\ntotal_hours_mon_tue = monday_hours + tuesday_hours\n\n# Print the total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday\nprint(total_hours_mon_tue)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total hours of TV watched by Frankie on Monday and Tuesday.

Since Frankie watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show on Thursday, and two 1-hour episodes on Friday, we can calculate the total hours as follows:\n\n- Thursday: 1 hour + 0.5 hours (since 30 minutes is half an hour)\n- Friday: 2 hours\n\nWe can add these hours to get the total hours watched on Thursday and Friday.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the hours watched on Thursday and Friday\nthursday_hours = 1 + 0.5  # 1 hour + 0.5 hours\nfriday_hours = 2  # 2 hours\n\n# Calculate the total hours watched on Thursday and Friday\ntotal_hours_thu_fri = thursday_hours + friday_hours\n\n# Print the total hours watched on Thursday and Friday\nprint(total_hours_thu_fri)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total hours of TV watched by Frankie on Thursday and Friday.

We already calculated the total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday (2 hours) and Thursday and Friday (3.5 hours). We can add these hours to get the total hours watched on all days except Wednesday.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday\ntotal_hours_mon_tue = 2\n\n# Define the total hours watched on Thursday and Friday\ntotal_hours_thu_fri = 3.5\n\n# Calculate the total hours watched on all days except Wednesday\ntotal_hours_except_wed = total_hours_mon_tue + total_hours_thu_fri\n\n# Print the total hours watched on all days except Wednesday\nprint(total_hours_except_wed)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total hours of TV watched by Frankie on all days except Wednesday.

Since each episode is 30 minutes long, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour).\n\nWe already calculated the total hours watched on Wednesday (1.5 hours). We can use this value to calculate the number of 30-minute episodes watched.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total hours watched on Wednesday\nhours_wednesday = 1.5\n\n# Define the duration of each episode in hours\nepisode_duration_hours = 30 / 60  # 30 minutes / 60\n\n# Calculate the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday\nnum_episodes_wednesday = hours_wednesday / episode_duration_hours\n\n# Print the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday\nprint(num_episodes_wednesday)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of 30-minute episodes watched by Frankie on Wednesday.
