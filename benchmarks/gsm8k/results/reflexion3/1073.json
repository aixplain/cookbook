One monkey eats 10 bananas each day. The second monkey eats 4 more bananas than the first monkey and the third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day.  How many bananas does the third monkey eat each day?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'To calculate the total number of bananas available per day, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of days they will last. Since Mr. Robles buys 315 bananas, which is enough to feed his three monkeys for a week (7 days), we can calculate the total number of bananas available per day as follows:\n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n```python\n# Define the total number of bananas and the number of days\ntotal_bananas = 315\ndays = 7\n\n# Calculate the total number of bananas available per day\nbananas_per_day = total_bananas // days\n\nprint(bananas_per_day)\n```\nThis code will calculate the total number of bananas available per day and print the result.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of bananas available per day is 45.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n```python\n# Define the total number of bananas available per day and the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey per day\nbananas_per_day = 45\nfirst_monkey_bananas = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey per day\nprint(f\"The first monkey eats {first_monkey_bananas} bananas per day.\")\n```\nThis code will calculate and print the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey per day.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The provided code does not calculate anything new, it simply prints the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey per day, which is already defined as 10.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n```python\n# Define the total number of bananas available per day, the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey per day, and the additional bananas eaten by the second monkey per day\nbananas_per_day = 45\nfirst_monkey_bananas = 10\nadditional_bananas = 4\n\n# Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey per day\nsecond_monkey_bananas = first_monkey_bananas + additional_bananas\n\nprint(f\"The second monkey eats {second_monkey_bananas} bananas per day.\")\n```\nThis code will calculate the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey per day by adding the additional bananas eaten by the second monkey to the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The code calculates the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey per day by adding the additional bananas eaten by the second monkey to the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n```python\n# Define the total number of bananas available per day, \n# the number of bananas eaten by the first monkey per day, \n# and the number of bananas eaten by the second monkey per day\nbananas_per_day = 45\nfirst_monkey_bananas = 10\nsecond_monkey_bananas = 14\n\n# Calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey per day\nthird_monkey_bananas = bananas_per_day - first_monkey_bananas - second_monkey_bananas\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer\nprint(f\"The third monkey eats the rest of the bananas for the day, which is {third_monkey_bananas} bananas per day, bananas, {third_monkey_bananas}\")\n```\nThis code will calculate the number of bananas eaten by the third monkey per day by subtracting the number of bananas eaten by the first and second monkeys from the total number of bananas available per day.
