    "question": "Paul is at a train station and is waiting for his train. He isn't sure how long he needs to wait, but he knows that the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station is the one he needs to get on. The first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes, and this train will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives.  The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves, and this is the train Paul will board.  In total, how long, in minutes, will Paul wait for his train?",

        "output": "The explanation for the solution is as follows:\n\nPaul needs to wait for his train, which is the fourth train scheduled to arrive at the station. To calculate the total time Paul needs to wait for his train, we need to calculate the time between the arrival of the first train and the arrival of the fourth train.\n\nThe first train is scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes and will stay in the station for 20 minutes. The second train is to arrive half an hour after the first train leaves the station, and this second train will stay in the station for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed in the station. The third train is to arrive an hour after the second train leaves the station, and this third train is to leave the station immediately after it arrives. The fourth train will arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves.\n\nWe have already calculated the time between the first and second trains, the time the second train stays in the station, the time between the second and third trains, and the time between the third and fourth trains.\n\nUsing these values, we can calculate the total time Paul needs to wait for his train.\n\nThe unit for the solution is minutes.\n\nThe final answer is 145.",
