We can multiply the initial height by 2/3 to get the height after the first bounce.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial height and the bounce ratio\ninitial_height = 72\nbounce_ratio = 2/3\n\n# Calculate the height after the first bounce\nheight_after_first_bounce = initial_height * bounce_ratio\n\n# Print the height after the first bounce\nprint(\"The height after the first bounce is:\", height_after_first_bounce)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the height after the first bounce by multiplying the initial height by the bounce ratio and print the result.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The height after the first bounce is 48.0'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the height after the second bounce, we need to determine the height of the ball after it bounces to 2/3rds of its height after the first bounce.
