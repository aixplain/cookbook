Ellen takes 1 unshaken soda, and her brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas, for a total of 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 sodas taken.\n\nNow, we will calculate the total number of sodas left by subtracting the number of sodas taken from the initial number of sodas.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total number of sodas left:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial number of sodas\ninitial_sodas = 12\n\n# Define the number of sodas taken by Ellen and her brother\nsodas_taken = 1 + 1 + 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of sodas left\nsodas_left = initial_sodas - sodas_taken\n\n# Print the total number of sodas left\nprint(sodas_left)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of sodas left after Ellen and her brother took some sodas is 8.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a scenario where Ellen initially has 12 sodas, shakes 3 of them, takes 1 unshaken soda for herself, and then her brother takes 1 shaken soda and 2 unshaken sodas.
