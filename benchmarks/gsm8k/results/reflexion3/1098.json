To calculate Martha's age, we need to subtract 4 years from Mike's age.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define Mike's age\nmike_age = 24\n\n# Calculate Martha's age by subtracting 4 years from Mike's age\nmartha_age = mike_age - 4\n\n# Print Martha's age\nprint(martha_age)\n```\n\nThis will give us Martha's age, which we can use in the next step to calculate Jeff's age.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Martha's age is 20.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the information that Martha is 20 years old and Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. To calculate Jeff's age, we need to add 10 years to Martha's age.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define Martha's age\nmartha_age = 20\n\n# Calculate Jeff's age by adding 10 years to Martha's age\njeff_age = martha_age + 10\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and Jeff's age\nprint(f\"Jeff is {10} years older than Martha, years old, {jeff_age}\")\n```\n\nThis will give us Jeff's age, which we can use to provide the final answer in the required format.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Jeff is 30 years old.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the information that Mike is 24 years old and Martha is 4 years younger than Mike.
