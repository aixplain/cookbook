The initial charge was $85.00, the returned item cost was $15.00, and the amount spent after returning the item is $43.00. The total amount spent is $85.00 - $15.00 + $43.00 = $113.00.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a scenario where Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.
