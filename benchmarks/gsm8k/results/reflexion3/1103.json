Since a fifth of the jellyfish are large, the number of large jellyfish is 90/5.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate this value. Please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# define the total number of jellyfish\ntotal_jellyfish = 90\n\n# calculate the number of large jellyfish\nlarge_jellyfish = total_jellyfish / 5\n\n# print the number of large jellyfish\nprint(large_jellyfish)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of large jellyfish in the tank.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of large jellyfish in the tank is 18.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where a fifth of the jellyfish are large, and a third of the large jellyfish change color from green to blue under UV light. We are also given that 6 jellyfish changed color when the UV light was turned on.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the total number of jellyfish in the tank using the equation (x/5) * (1/3) = 6. The solution to this equation was x = 90, which is the total number of jellyfish in the tank. We also calculated the total number of large jellyfish in the tank, which is 18.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the final answer as an integer and provide an explanation and unit for the answer. Since we already have the total number of jellyfish in the tank, we can use this value as the final answer.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can print the final answer along with an explanation and unit. Please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# define the total number of jellyfish\ntotal_jellyfish = 90\n\n# print the explanation, unit, and final answer\nprint(\"There are\", total_jellyfish, \"jellyfish in the tank.\", \"jellyfish\", \",\", total_jellyfish)\n```\n\nThis will give us the final answer in the required format.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'There are 90 jellyfish in the tank. jellyfish , 90'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the final answer as an integer along with the explanation and unit\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
