The correct response should be [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer] format is not followed for the second part of the answer. The correct response should be: The fifth worker produced 180 toys in total and 18 toys per hour can be rephrased as [The fifth worker produced 180 toys in total and 18 toys per hour, toys per hour, 18].\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where a toy manufacturer receives an order for 400 toys. 5 workers are available to work on the order. 2 of the workers produce 6 toys an hour, and another 2 workers produce 4 toys an hour.

They all work on the order during their 10-hour shift, and by the end of their shift the manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order.\n\nWe have already calculated the total number of toys produced by the first four workers, which is 200. We have also calculated the total number of toys needed minus the remaining toys needed to be shipped, which is 380.\n\nNow, we need to subtract the total number of toys produced by the first four workers from the total number of toys needed minus the remaining toys needed to be shipped. This will give us the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following formula:\n\nTotal toys produced by fifth worker = Total toys needed minus remaining toys - Total toys produced by first four workers\n\nWe can calculate this using the python_repl tool. Please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker\ntotal_toys_needed_minus_remaining = 380\ntoys_produced_by_first_four_workers = 200\ntoys_produced_by_fifth_worker = total_toys_needed_minus_remaining - toys_produced_by_first_four_workers\nprint(toys_produced_by_fifth_worker)\n```\n\nAlso, we need to calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour. We can do this by dividing the total number of toys produced by the fifth worker by the number of hours worked, which is 10.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of toys produced by the fifth worker per hour\nhours_worked = 10\ntoys_produced_by_fifth_worker_per_hour = toys_produced_by_fifth_worker / hours_worked\nprint(toys_produced_by_fifth_worker_per_hour)\n```\n\nPlease provide the output of the above commands in the following format:\n\n[Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\n\nFor example: [The fifth worker produced 180 toys in total and 18 toys per hour, toys per hour, 18]\n\nPlease execute the following python command to get the final answer:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the final answer\nfinal_answer = [f\"The fifth worker produced {toys_produced_by_fifth_worker} toys in total and {toys_produced_by_fifth_worker_per_hour} toys per hour\", \"toys per hour\", int(toys_produced_by_fifth_worker_per_hour)]\nprint(final_answer)\n```",
