The explanation should be in the format \"Seth had [total_stickers_Seth_had] stickers in the beginning.\" and the unit should be \"stickers\".'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning. The unit for the answer is stickers.'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
