    "question": "Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. He has two mugs of water. One mug is 33 degrees. The other is an unknown temperature. If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?",

If he pours 4 ounces of water from the 33-degree mug into his water bottle and one ounce from the other bottle, he is now able to drink the water.  At least how many degrees is the second bottle?\n\nExplanation: \nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the minimum temperature of the second bottle of water. We know that the total amount of water in the water bottle after pouring is 5 ounces. We also know that the amount of heat added to the water bottle from the 33-degree mug is 3907.2 calories. We also know that Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. This means that the total temperature of the water in the water bottle after pouring must be at least 40 degrees.\n\nUnit: degrees Celsius\n\nFinal Answer: 68",
