The result of this division is 9 eggs per child.\n\nNow, we need to format the answer as per the required format, which is [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. We have already calculated the explanation, unit, and final answer in the previous steps.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to format the answer. Here's the code for the next step:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"Chatty prepared three dozen eggs for her four children's Easter activity. Three dozen eggs is 36 eggs. 36 eggs divided by 4 children is 9 eggs per child.\"\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"eggs\"\n\n# Define the final answer\nfinal_answer = 9\n\n# Print the answer in the required format\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the final answer.",
