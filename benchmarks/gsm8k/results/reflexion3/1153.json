We can represent this as an equation: jim_seashells = carlos_seashells + 5.\n\nWe already know that jim_seashells is 27. So, we can solve for carlos_seashells by subtracting 5 from jim_seashells.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following command:\n\n```\njim_seashells = 27\ncarlos_seashells = jim_seashells - 5\nprint(carlos_seashells)\n```\n\nThis will calculate the number of seashells Carlos collected and print its value.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Carlos collected 22 seashells.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nCalculate the number of seashells Carrey collected.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the information that Carlos collected twice as many seashells as Carrey. We can represent this as an equation: carlos_seashells = 2 * carrey_seashells.\n\nWe already know that carlos_seashells is 22.
