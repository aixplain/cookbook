He buys a device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. He bought 2 devices last Monday and 4 devices last Tuesday. \n\nIn the previous step, we calculated the total cost of buying the devices, which is $120.\n\nTo calculate the total revenue from selling the devices, we need to multiply the selling price of one device by the total number of devices sold. Since Linus sells each device for twice the original price, the selling price of one device is 2 * $20 = $40.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to calculate the total revenue from selling the devices.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total revenue:\n\n```python\n# Define the selling price of one device\nselling_price_per_device = 40\n\n# Define the number of devices bought on Monday and Tuesday\ndevices_bought_monday = 2\ndevices_bought_tuesday = 4\n\n# Calculate the total number of devices sold\ntotal_devices_sold = devices_bought_monday + devices_bought_tuesday\n\n# Calculate the total revenue from selling the devices\ntotal_revenue = selling_price_per_device * total_devices_sold\n\n# Print the total revenue\nprint(total_revenue)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the total revenue from selling the devices.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total revenue from selling the devices is $240.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Linus buys mobile devices and sells them for a profit.
