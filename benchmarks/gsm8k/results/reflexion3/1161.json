To do this, we can simply use the given value of $50.\n\nHowever, to make it clear and to use it in the next steps, let's write a Python code to calculate this value.\n\n```python\n# Define the total area of land\ntotal_area = 80\n\n# Calculate the area of half of the land\nhalf_area = total_area / 2\n\n# Given money earned from selling half of the land\nmoney_from_half = 50\n\nprint(money_from_half)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The money earned from selling half of the land is $50.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.

We need to calculate the total money earned from selling all his unused land.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated the money earned from selling half of the land, which is $50.\n\nNow, let's calculate the money earned from selling a quarter of the land. To do this, we can use the given value of $30.\n\nHowever, to make it clear and to use it in the next steps, let's write a Python code to calculate this value.\n\n```python\n# Define the total area of land\ntotal_area = 80\n\n# Calculate the area of half of the land\nhalf_area = total_area / 2\n\n# Calculate the area of a quarter of the land\nquarter_area = total_area / 4\n\n# Given money earned from selling half of the land\nmoney_from_half = 50\n\n# Given money earned from selling a quarter of the land\nmoney_from_quarter = 30\n\nprint(money_from_quarter)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The money earned from selling a quarter of the land is 30.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Abraham owns 80 square meters of unused land.

We need to calculate the total money earned from selling all his unused land.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the money earned from selling half of the land, which is $50, and the money earned from selling a quarter of the land, which is $30.\n\nNow, let's calculate the money earned from selling the remaining land. To do this, we need to first calculate the area of the remaining land. We can do this by subtracting the area of half of the land and a quarter of the land from the total area.\n\nThen, we can multiply the area of the remaining land by the price per square meter, which is $3, to get the money earned from selling the remaining land.\n\nHere's a Python code to calculate this value:\n\n```python\n# Define the total area of land\ntotal_area = 80\n\n# Calculate the area of half of the land\nhalf_area = total_area / 2\n\n# Calculate the area of a quarter of the land\nquarter_area = total_area / 4\n\n# Calculate the area of the remaining land\nremaining_area = total_area - half_area - quarter_area\n\n# Given money earned from selling half of the land\nmoney_from_half = 50\n\n# Given money earned from selling a quarter of the land\nmoney_from_quarter = 30\n\n# Price per square meter\nprice_per_square_meter = 3\n\n# Calculate the money earned from selling the remaining land\nmoney_from_remaining = remaining_area * price_per_square_meter\n\nprint(money_from_remaining)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The money earned from selling the remaining land is $60.0.
