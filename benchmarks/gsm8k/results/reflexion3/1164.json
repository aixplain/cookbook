Please provide the output of this code as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of eggs hidden by Cole is 36.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP: Calculate the number of eggs found by Lamar\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\nWe have determined that Cole hid a total of 36 eggs. Now, we need to calculate the number of eggs found by Lamar. According to the problem, Lamar finds 5 eggs.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of eggs hidden by Cole\ntotal_eggs = 36\n\n# Define the number of eggs found by Lamar\neggs_found_by_lamar = 5\n\n# Print the number of eggs found by Lamar\nprint(\"The number of eggs found by Lamar is:\", eggs_found_by_lamar)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of eggs found by Lamar. Please provide the output of this code as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of eggs found by Lamar is 5.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP: Calculate the number of eggs found by Stacy\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\nWe have determined that Cole hid a total of 36 eggs and Lamar found 5 eggs. Now, we need to calculate the number of eggs found by Stacy. According to the problem, Stacy finds twice as many eggs as Lamar.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of eggs hidden by Cole\ntotal_eggs = 36\n\n# Define the number of eggs found by Lamar\neggs_found_by_lamar = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of eggs found by Stacy\neggs_found_by_stacy = eggs_found_by_lamar * 2\n\n# Print the number of eggs found by Stacy\nprint(\"The number of eggs found by Stacy is:\", eggs_found_by_stacy)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of eggs found by Stacy. Please provide the output of this code as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of eggs found by Stacy is 10.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP: Calculate the number of eggs found by Charlie\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\nWe have determined that Cole hid a total of 36 eggs, Lamar found 5 eggs, and Stacy found 10 eggs. Now, we need to calculate the number of eggs found by Charlie. According to the problem, Charlie finds 2 less eggs than Stacy.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of eggs hidden by Cole\ntotal_eggs = 36\n\n# Define the number of eggs found by Lamar\neggs_found_by_lamar = 5\n\n# Define the number of eggs found by Stacy\neggs_found_by_stacy = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of eggs found by Charlie\neggs_found_by_charlie = eggs_found_by_stacy - 2\n\n# Print the number of eggs found by Charlie\nprint(\"The number of eggs found by Charlie is:\", eggs_found_by_charlie)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of eggs found by Charlie.

Please provide the output of this code as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, we need to calculate the number of eggs found by Mei and the total number of eggs found by all the children. Then we can calculate the number of eggs still hidden in the yard.\n\nPlease add the following code to the above code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of eggs found by Mei\neggs_found_by_mei = eggs_found_by_charlie // 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of eggs found by all the children\ntotal_eggs_found = eggs_found_by_lamar + eggs_found_by_stacy + eggs_found_by_charlie + eggs_found_by_mei\n\n# Calculate the number of eggs still hidden in the yard\neggs_still_hidden = total_eggs - total_eggs_found\n\n# Print the number of eggs still hidden in the yard\nprint(\"The number of eggs still hidden in the yard is:\", eggs_still_hidden)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of eggs still hidden in the yard.
