Now, you need to add this amount to Jack's $100.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define Jack's amount\njack_amount = 100\n\n# Define 1/5 of Sophia's amount\none_fifth_of_sophia_amount = 20.0\n\n# Calculate the total amount\ntotal_amount = jack_amount + one_fifth_of_sophia_amount\n\n# Print the result as [Explanation, unit, final answer]\nprint(f\"Jack had ${jack_amount}.
