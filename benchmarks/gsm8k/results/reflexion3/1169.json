We already know that x is equal to 0.6*R and Rissa gave 3.0 to her little sister.\n\nWe also know that Ronnie had R and Rissa had 3R. Since Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, we can set up an equation to represent the situation.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the value of x for Ronnie.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nR = 5  # Initial amount of money Ronnie had\n\n# Calculate the amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister\nx = 0.6 * R\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"The amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister is\", x)\n```\n\nThis will give us the amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister. We can then use this value to find the amount of money left in Ronnie's account.\n\nAlso, we need to calculate the amount of money left in Ronnie's account after giving away x.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nR = 5  # Initial amount of money Ronnie had\nx = 0.6 * R  # Amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister\n\n# Calculate the amount of money left in Ronnie's account\nmoney_left = R - x\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"The amount of money left in Ronnie's account is\", money_left)\n```\n\nThis will give us the amount of money left in Ronnie's account.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister is 3.0 and the amount of money left in Ronnie's account is 2.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 5:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo determine the final answer, we need to calculate the amount of money left with Ronnie.\n\nWe already know that Ronnie had 5 dollars initially and gave away 3 dollars to his little sister. We also know that the amount of money left in Ronnie's account is 2 dollars.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the final answer.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ninitial_money = 5  # Initial amount of money Ronnie had\nmoney_given_away = 3  # Amount of money Ronnie gave to his little sister\nmoney_left = initial_money - money_given_away  # Amount of money left in Ronnie's account\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"The explanation is: Ronnie had\", initial_money, \"dollars and gave away\", money_given_away, \"dollars to his little sister.\")\nprint(\"The unit is: dollars\")\nprint(\"The final answer is:\", money_left)\n```\n\nThis will give us the final answer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The final answer is 2.
