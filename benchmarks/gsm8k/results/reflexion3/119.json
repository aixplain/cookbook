Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate Lylah's salary four years ago, we need to first determine Adrien's salary four years ago and then use the information that Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's.\n\nGiven that Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, we can set up an equation to represent the relationship between Adrien's and Lylah's salaries. Let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as x.\n\nSince Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can write the equation as:\n\n40000 = x + (30/100)x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n40000 = 1.3x\n\nNow, divide both sides by 1.3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 40000 / 1.3\n\nTo find the value of x, we can use the python_repl tool. Please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Lylah's salary four years ago\nlylah_salary_four_years_ago = 40000 / 1.3\nprint(lylah_salary_four_years_ago)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Lylah's salary four years ago was $30769.23.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate Adrien's salary four years later, we need to first determine his salary four years ago and then use the information that his salary had increased by 40% four years later.\n\nGiven that Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, we can calculate his salary four years later by adding a 40% increase to his original salary.\n\nLet's use the python_repl tool to calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Adrien's salary four years later\nadrien_salary_four_years_ago = 40000\nadrien_salary_four_years_later = adrien_salary_four_years_ago + (0.4 * adrien_salary_four_years_ago)\nprint(adrien_salary_four_years_later)\n```\n\nAlso, we need to calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since we know that Lylah's salary four years ago was $30769.23, we can assume that her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's. However, we do not have information about the percentage increase in Lylah's salary. Therefore, we will assume that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's salary four years ago, which is 30% higher than Lylah's original salary, and then increased by some percentage four years later. Since we do not have the exact percentage, we will assume that Lylah's salary increased by the same percentage as Adrien's, which is 40%.\n\nPlease execute the following Python code to calculate Lylah's salary four years later:\n\n```python\n# Calculate Lylah's salary four years later\nlylah_salary_four_years_ago = 30769.23\nlylah_salary_four_years_later = lylah_salary_four_years_ago + (0.4 * lylah_salary_four_years_ago)\nprint(lylah_salary_four_years_later)\n```\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later. Please execute the following Python code to calculate the total salary:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total salary four years later\ntotal_salary_four_years_later = adrien_salary_four_years_later + lylah_salary_four_years_later\nprint(total_salary_four_years_later)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total salary that Adrien and Lylah were receiving four years later is $99016.52.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate Lylah's salary four years later, we need to first determine her salary four years ago and then use the information that her salary increased simultaneously with Adrien's. \n\nGiven that Lylah's salary four years ago was $30769.23, we can calculate her salary four years later by adding a 40% increase to her original salary.\n\nLet's use the python_repl tool to calculate Lylah's salary four years later.

The explanation should be in the format \"Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000. Lylah's salary four years ago was $30769.23. Adrien's salary four years later was $56000.
