We will use this result in the next step to calculate the total number of pens Alain has.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of red pens is 25.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of black pens, we need to multiply the number of packs of black pens by the number of pens in each pack. We know that Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens. So, we will first calculate the number of packs of black pens by multiplying the number of packs of red pens by 2.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of packs of red pens\npacks_of_red_pens = 5\n\n# Define the number of packs of black pens as twice the number of packs of red pens\npacks_of_black_pens = packs_of_red_pens * 2\n\n# Define the number of pens in each pack\npens_per_pack = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of black pens\nblack_pens = packs_of_black_pens * pens_per_pack\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The number of black pens is:\", black_pens)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of black pens. We will use this result in the next step to calculate the total number of pens Alain has.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of black pens is: 50'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of pens Alain has, we need to add the number of red pens and the number of black pens.

We will use this result to provide the final answer in the required format.\n\nAlso, please provide the explanation and unit for the final answer. The explanation should be in the format \"Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red.

The unit should be \"pens\".'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens and also bought twice the amount of black pens than the red.
