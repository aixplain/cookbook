        "output": "To calculate the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, we need to combine 14 mL of one medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. First, we calculate the amount of the second medicine by multiplying the amount of the first medicine by 3, which is 14 * 3 = 42 mL. Then, we calculate the total amount of medicine in one dose by adding the amount of the first medicine and the amount of the second medicine, which is 14 + 42 = 56 mL. Finally, we multiply the total amount by 8 to get the total amount of medicine in 8 doses, which is 56 * 8 = 448 mL.\n\nmL, 448",
