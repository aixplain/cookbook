Please provide the output of this command as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount Stephen paid in the first 11 months is $275.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given that Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed. In the previous steps, we calculated the total interest Stephen owes, which is $6.0, and the total amount Stephen paid in the first 11 months, which is $275. Now, we need to calculate the total amount Stephen borrowed plus the interest.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the principal amount and total interest\nprincipal = 300\ntotal_interest = 6.0\n\n# Calculate the total amount Stephen borrowed plus the interest\ntotal_amount_borrowed_plus_interest = principal + total_interest\n\n# Print the total amount borrowed plus interest\nprint(total_amount_borrowed_plus_interest)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount Stephen borrowed plus the interest. Please provide the output of this command as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount Stephen borrowed plus the interest is $306.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given that Stephen borrowed $300 from his sister and promised to return it with an additional 2% of the money he owed.
