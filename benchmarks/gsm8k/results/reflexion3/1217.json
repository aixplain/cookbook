The cost of one visit is $2. After 5 years, the cost of one visit has increased by 150%, but Pauline decided not to give up any visit and continued to go to the museum for 3 more years. How much did Pauline spend on all visits to the museum?\nFEEDBACK: The final answer should be the total cost for 8 years. The provided code only calculates the cost for one year. The total cost should be 8 * 75 = 600. However, the code provided does not show this calculation. It seems like the worker directly provided the final answer without showing the calculation. The correct code should be:\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\nyearly_cost = 75\nnumber_of_years = 8\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = yearly_cost * number_of_years\n\n# Format the final answer\nexplanation = \"Pauline spent a total of\"\nunit = \"dollars on visits to the museum\"\nfinal_answer = [explanation, unit, total_cost]\n\n# Print the result\nprint(final_answer)\n```\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'To calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years, we need to multiply the number of visits per year by the cost per visit and then multiply by the number of years.\n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the cost of the visits for the first 5 years.
