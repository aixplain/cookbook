We then added these two amounts to get the final answer.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total cost of the tables and the roof frames\ntotal_cost_tables = 80\ntotal_cost_roof_frames = 20\n\n# Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John\ntotal_amount = total_cost_tables + total_cost_roof_frames\n\n# Print the explanation and the final answer\nprint(\"John manufactured 4 wooden tables for $20 each and 2 roof frames for $10 each.
