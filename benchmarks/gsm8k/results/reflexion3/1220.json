The longer piece is 4 times longer than the shorter piece. We need to calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4.\n\nIn the previous steps, we set up an equation based on this information and solved for x. The value of x is 8, which means the shorter piece is 8 feet long.\n\nNow, we need to calculate the length of the longer piece by multiplying x by 4.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to calculate the length of the longer piece.\n\n```python\n# Define the variable\nx = 8\n\n# Calculate the length of the longer piece\nlonger_piece_length = x * 4\n\n# Print the length of the longer piece\nprint(\"The length of the longer piece is:\", longer_piece_length)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The length of the longer piece is 32 feet.'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
