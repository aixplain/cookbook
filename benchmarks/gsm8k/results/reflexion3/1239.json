The custodian has to clean 80 classrooms and it takes them 15 minutes per classroom. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms in minutes by multiplying the number of classrooms by the time spent per classroom. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of classrooms\nclassrooms = 80\n\n# Define the time spent per classroom in minutes\ntime_per_classroom = 15\n\n# Calculate the total time spent cleaning all classrooms in minutes\ntotal_time = classrooms * time_per_classroom\n\n# Print the total time spent cleaning all classrooms in minutes\nprint(total_time)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total time spent cleaning all classrooms in minutes is 1200.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the percentage of the day spent cleaning classrooms.
