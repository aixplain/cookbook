We have already defined this relationship in Python as blueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4.\n\nNow, we need to set up an equation to represent the total number of ice cubes. We know that the total number of ice cubes is 116, which is the sum of strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please define a variable total_cubes and set it to 116. Then, set up an equation to represent the total number of ice cubes using the variables strawberry_cubes and blueberry_cubes.\n\nFor example, you can use the following code as a starting point:\n\n```python\nstrawberry_cubes = 0  # Initialize strawberry_cubes variable\nblueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4  # Define the relationship between blueberry_cubes and strawberry_cubes\ntotal_cubes = 116  # Define the total number of ice cubes\nequation = strawberry_cubes + blueberry_cubes  # Set up an equation to represent the total number of ice cubes\n```\n\nHowever, please note that we don't know the value of strawberry_cubes yet, so we can't calculate the exact value of blueberry_cubes and the equation. We just need to set up the equation using the variables.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the above code and set up the equation to represent the total number of ice cubes.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The equation to represent the total number of ice cubes is strawberry_cubes + blueberry_cubes, where blueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4 and total_cubes = 116.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Mary makes strawberry cubes and blueberry cubes for a cocktail party. The number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. We have already defined this relationship in Python as blueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4. We have also set up an equation to represent the total number of ice cubes using the variables strawberry_cubes and blueberry_cubes, which is strawberry_cubes + blueberry_cubes, where blueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4 and total_cubes = 116.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please solve the equation for the number of blueberry cubes. We can substitute the expression for blueberry_cubes into the equation and solve for strawberry_cubes. Then, we can use the value of strawberry_cubes to calculate the number of blueberry_cubes.\n\nFor example, you can use the following code as a starting point:\n\n```python\nstrawberry_cubes = 0  # Initialize strawberry_cubes variable\nblueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4  # Define the relationship between blueberry_cubes and strawberry_cubes\ntotal_cubes = 116  # Define the total number of ice cubes\nequation = strawberry_cubes + blueberry_cubes  # Set up an equation to represent the total number of ice cubes\n\n# Solve the equation for strawberry_cubes\nstrawberry_cubes = (total_cubes + 4) / 6\n\n# Calculate the number of blueberry_cubes\nblueberry_cubes = 5 * strawberry_cubes - 4\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(\"The number of blueberry cubes is\", int(blueberry_cubes))\n```\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the above code and solve the equation for the number of blueberry cubes.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of blueberry cubes is 96'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nCalculate the final answer and provide the explanation\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
