We also know that Brendan initially had 10 marbles and dropped 5, so he had 10 - 5 = 5 marbles left in his bag. Then he picked up 3 more marbles, but one of them was a bead, so he got rid of it.\n\nWe need to calculate the total number of marbles Brendan has after picking up and removing the bead. To do this, we can use simple addition to find the sum of the number of marbles Brendan had left in his bag and the number of marbles he picked up, then subtract 1 to account for the bead.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of marbles Brendan had left in his bag\nmarbles_left_in_bag = 5\n\n# Define the number of marbles Brendan picked up\npicked_up_marbles = 3\n\n# Calculate the total number of marbles Brendan has after picking up\ntotal_marbles_before_removing_bead = marbles_left_in_bag + picked_up_marbles\n\n# Calculate the total number of marbles Brendan has after removing the bead\ntotal_marbles_after_removing_bead = total_marbles_before_removing_bead - 1\n\n# Print the explanation and the final answer\nprint(f\"Brendan had {marbles_left_in_bag} marbles left in his bag and picked up {picked_up_marbles} more, but one of them was a bead, so he got rid of it. Therefore, Brendan has {total_marbles_after_removing_bead} marbles.\")\nprint(\"marbles\")\nprint(total_marbles_after_removing_bead)\n```\n\nThis will give us the explanation and the total number of marbles Brendan has after picking up and removing the bead.
