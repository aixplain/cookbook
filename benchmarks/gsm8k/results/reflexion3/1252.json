We are also given that there were 20 helmets. We need to calculate the total number of items Dominick saw.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the number of robots by dividing the number of helmets by 2. The output was 10.0. Then, we calculated the number of footballs by multiplying the number of helmets by 2. The output was 40. Finally, we calculated the total number of items by adding the number of robots, helmets, and footballs. The output was 70.\n\nNow, let's provide the final answer as an integer along with the explanation and unit.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"Dominick saw half as many robots as helmets and half as many helmets as footballs in the changing room. There were 20 helmets. So, the total number of items is the sum of the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.\"\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"items\"\n\n# Define the total number of items\ntotal_items = 70\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(f\"The final answer is [{explanation}, {unit}, {int(total_items)}].\")\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the final answer.",
