In the previous steps, we calculated the cost of each additional phone to be $10, the total cost of the additional phones to be $40, and the total cost of the whole phone plan to be $60.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"There are five phones on a phone plan. The main phone costs twice as much as each additional phone. If the main phone plan costs $20, the total cost of the whole phone plan is the sum of the cost of the main phone and the total cost of the additional phones.\"\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"dollars\"\n\n# Define the final answer\nfinal_answer = 60\n\n# Print the final answer as an integer, along with the explanation and unit\nprint(f\"The final answer is [{explanation}, {unit}, {final_answer}].\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the final answer as an integer, along with the explanation and unit, which we can use to provide the final answer in the required format.",
