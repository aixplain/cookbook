Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges.\n\nPlease use the following code as a starting point:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of a pepper\ncost_of_pepper = 15\n\n# Define the cost of a watermelon\ncost_of_watermelon = 45\n\n# Define the cost of an orange\ncost_of_orange = 40\n\n# Define the number of watermelons, peppers, and oranges Dillon buys\nnum_watermelons = 4\nnum_peppers = 20\nnum_oranges = 10\n\n# Calculate the total cost of watermelons\ntotal_cost_watermelons = num_watermelons * cost_of_watermelon\n\n# Calculate the total cost of peppers\ntotal_cost_peppers = num_peppers * cost_of_pepper\n\n# Calculate the total cost of oranges\ntotal_cost_oranges = num_oranges * cost_of_orange\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend\ntotal_cost = total_cost_watermelons + total_cost_peppers + total_cost_oranges\n\n# Print the total cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges\nprint(\"Dillon buys 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. The total cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges is dollars, \", total_cost)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the total cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges.\n\nAlso, provide the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer] in the following format:\n\n\"The total cost of watermelons, peppers, and oranges is dollars, 715\"",
