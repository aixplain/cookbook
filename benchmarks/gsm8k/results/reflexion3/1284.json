Initially, there were 5 children following the truck. On the second street, each child was joined by another child, resulting in 10 children. Now, on the third street, each child in the existing group is joined by another 2 children, resulting in 30 children. However, the original 5 children then give up and leave the group.\n\nWe need to calculate the final number of children after the third street, taking into account that the original 5 children left the group.\n\nTo do this, we can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of children after the third street\nchildren_after_third_street = 30\n\n# Define the number of original children who left the group\noriginal_children_left = 5\n\n# Calculate the final number of children after the third street\nfinal_children = children_after_third_street - original_children_left\n\n# Print the result\nprint(final_children)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step. Also, provide the explanation and unit for the final answer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The final number of children after the third street is 25.
