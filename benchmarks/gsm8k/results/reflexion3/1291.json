        "output": "Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. If George has 18 pens, to find the number of pens Sarah has, we first need to calculate the number of pens Timothy has by multiplying the number of pens George has by 3, which is 54 pens. Then, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2 to find the number of pens Sarah has. The result is 27 pens. pens, 27",
