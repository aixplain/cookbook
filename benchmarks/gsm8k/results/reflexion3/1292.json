To find Anne's height, we need to multiply Albert's height by 2.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\nalbert_height = 36\nanne_height = albert_height * 2\nprint(anne_height)\n```\n\nThis will give us Anne's height, which we can use in the next step to find Jackie's height before summer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Anne's height is 72 inches.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the information that Anne is 72\" tall and Jackie is 2\" shorter than Anne. To find Jackie's current height, we need to subtract 2 from Anne's height.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\nanne_height = 72\njackie_current_height = anne_height - 2\nprint(jackie_current_height)\n```\n\nThis will give us Jackie's current height, which we can use in the next step to find Jackie's height before summer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Jackie's current height is 70 inches.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the information that Jackie's current height is 70 inches and she grew 3 inches over the summer. To find Jackie's height before summer, we need to subtract 3 from her current height.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\njackie_current_height = 70\njackie_height_before_summer = jackie_current_height - 3\nprint(\"Jackie's height before summer was\", jackie_height_before_summer, \"inches.\")\n```\n\nThis will give us Jackie's height before summer, which we can use to provide the final answer in the required format.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Jackie's height before summer was 67 inches.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the information that Jackie's current height is 70 inches and she grew 3 inches over the summer.
