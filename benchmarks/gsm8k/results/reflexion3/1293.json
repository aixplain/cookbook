We will use this value in the next step to calculate the total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of bars produced in two weeks is 70000.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where a company produces 5000 chocolate bars per day and sells them for $2 per bar.
