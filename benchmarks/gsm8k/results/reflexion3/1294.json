The store has a buy one get one 50% off deal on T-shirts. Jake buys 2 T-shirts. The original price of each T-shirt is $8. Then, Jake buys a pair of shoes that is 40% off the original price. The original price of the shoes is $40. What is the total amount of money Jake spends at the store?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the cost of the T-shirts, we need to consider the buy one get one 50% off deal. Since Jake buys 2 T-shirts, he will pay the full price for one and 50% of the price for the second one.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to calculate the cost of the T-shirts. Here's a Python code snippet to do that:\n\n```python\n# Define the original price of a T-shirt\nt_shirt_price = 8\n\n# Calculate the cost of the first T-shirt (full price)\nfirst_t_shirt_cost = t_shirt_price\n\n# Calculate the cost of the second T-shirt (50% off)\nsecond_t_shirt_cost = t_shirt_price * 0.5\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the T-shirts\ntotal_t_shirt_cost = first_t_shirt_cost + second_t_shirt_cost\n\n# Print the total cost of the T-shirts\nprint(\"The total cost of the T-shirts is: \", total_t_shirt_cost)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total cost of the T-shirts is $12.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to consider the cost of the shoes in addition to the cost of the T-shirts.
