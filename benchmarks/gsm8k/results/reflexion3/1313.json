To calculate the total selling price, we need to first calculate the selling price of one watermelon. We can do this by adding the profit percentage to the cost price. Then, we can multiply the selling price by the number of watermelons to get the total revenue. Finally, we can subtract the total cost from the total revenue to get the total profit. Please use the following code to calculate the total selling price: \n\n```python\n# Define the cost price of one watermelon\ncost_price = 1.60\n\n# Define the number of watermelons\nnum_watermelons = 50\n\n# Define the profit percentage\nprofit_percentage = 0.25\n\n# Calculate the selling price of one watermelon\nselling_price = cost_price + (cost_price * profit_percentage)\n\n# Calculate the total revenue\ntotal_revenue = selling_price * num_watermelons\n\n# Print the result\nprint('The total selling price of all the watermelons is $', round(total_revenue, 2))\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total selling price of all the watermelons is $120.00'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\n\"Calculate the selling price of each watermelon.
