We can do this by adding the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance.\n\nThen, we can calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by subtracting the total number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by dividing the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiplying by 100.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate this by executing the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of students\ntotal_students = 20\n\n# Define the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance\ncontemporary_students = 4\n\n# Define the number of students enrolled in jazz dance\njazz_students = 4\n\n# Calculate the total number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance\ntotal_enrolled = contemporary_students + jazz_students\n\n# Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance\nhip_hop_students = total_students - total_enrolled\n\n# Calculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance\nhip_hop_percentage = (hip_hop_students / total_students) * 100\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is\", hip_hop_percentage, \"%\")\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance is 60.0%'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nCalculate the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
