If the monkeys need 200 bananas, the gorillas need 400 bananas, and the baboons need 100 bananas every month, how many bananas does he need to order to last for 2 months?\nFEEDBACK: The worker should have executed the python code using the python_repl tool and returned the output in the required format. The correct response should be in the format [explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total monthly banana needs of all the apes, we need to add up the monthly banana needs of the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons. \n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the monthly banana needs of each type of ape\nmonkeys_bananas = 200\ngorillas_bananas = 400\nbaboons_bananas = 100\n\n# Calculate the total monthly banana needs of all the apes\ntotal_monthly_bananas = monkeys_bananas + gorillas_bananas + baboons_bananas\n\n# Print the total monthly banana needs\nprint(total_monthly_bananas)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total monthly banana needs of all the apes. We will then use this value to calculate the total banana needs for 2 months.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total monthly banana needs of all the apes is 700. To calculate the total banana needs for 2 months, we need to multiply this value by 2, which gives us 1400.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total banana needs for 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly banana needs by 2.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total monthly banana needs of all the apes\ntotal_monthly_bananas = 700\n\n# Calculate the total banana needs for 2 months\ntotal_bananas_for_2_months = total_monthly_bananas * 2\n\n# Print the total banana needs for 2 months\nprint(\"The zookeeper needs to order\", total_bananas_for_2_months, \"bananas to last for 2 months.\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the total banana needs for 2 months.
