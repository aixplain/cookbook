The doll cost as much as 3 action figures and one red car cost $4. How much are all toys worth, of an action figure costs $5?\nFEEDBACK: The worker response does not match the required format. The correct response should be in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. The worker response should be something like: [\"The total worth of all toys is\", \"dollars\", 50].\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the cost of the doll, we need to first determine the cost of an action figure and a red car. We are given that one red car costs $4 and an action figure costs $5. Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures, we can calculate the cost of the doll by multiplying the cost of an action figure by 3.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of an action figure and a red car\ncost_action_figure = 5\ncost_red_car = 4\n\n# Calculate the cost of the doll\ncost_doll = 3 * cost_action_figure\n\nprint(\"The cost of the doll is: \", cost_doll)\n```\n\nThis will give us the cost of the doll.
