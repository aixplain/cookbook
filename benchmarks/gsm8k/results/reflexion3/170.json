Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times as much as the hat, and pants that cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. How much does each uniform cost total?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the cost of the jacket, we need to first determine the cost of the hat and then multiply it by 3. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the cost of the jacket as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of the hat\nhat_cost = 25\n\n# Calculate the cost of the jacket\njacket_cost = hat_cost * 3\n\n# Print the cost of the jacket\nprint(jacket_cost)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the cost of the jacket.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The cost of the jacket is 75.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the cost of the pants, we need to first determine the average cost of the hat and jacket. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the cost of the pants as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of the hat\nhat_cost = 25\n\n# Define the cost of the jacket\njacket_cost = 75\n\n# Calculate the cost of the pants as the average of the hat and jacket costs\npants_cost = (hat_cost + jacket_cost) / 2\n\n# Print the cost of the pants\nprint(pants_cost)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the cost of the pants.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The cost of the pants is 50.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total cost of the uniform, we need to add the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the total cost of the uniform as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of the hat\nhat_cost = 25\n\n# Define the cost of the jacket\njacket_cost = 75\n\n# Define the cost of the pants\npants_cost = 50.0\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the uniform\ntotal_cost = hat_cost + jacket_cost + pants_cost\n\n# Print the total cost of the uniform\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the total cost of the uniform. Also, provide the explanation as \"The total cost of the uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants\" and the unit as \"dollars\".'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total cost of the uniform is 150.0 dollars. The total cost of the uniform is the sum of the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo finalize the answer, we need to convert the total cost of the uniform from a float to an integer.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can convert the total cost of the uniform as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the total cost of the uniform\ntotal_cost = 150.0\n\n# Convert the total cost to an integer\ntotal_cost_integer = int(total_cost)\n\n# Print the total cost as an integer\nprint(total_cost_integer)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the total cost of the uniform as an integer.
