We need to calculate the total number of crabs the three have together.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the number of crabs Monic and Rani have. The results were 36 and 46, respectively.\n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of crabs the three have together. We can calculate this by adding the number of crabs Bo, Monic, and Rani have.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of crabs Bo, Monic, and Rani have\nbo_crabs = 40\nmonic_crabs = 36\nrani_crabs = 46\n\n# Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together\ntotal_crabs = bo_crabs + monic_crabs + rani_crabs\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and total number of crabs\nprint(\"Bo, Monic, and Rani have a total of \" + str(total_crabs) + \" crabs together.\")\nprint(\"Unit: crabs\")\nprint(\"Final answer as an integer: \" + str(total_crabs))\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of crabs the three have together, along with the explanation and unit.\n\nHowever, since we already know the total number of crabs is 122, we can modify the code to directly print the result.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of crabs Bo, Monic, and Rani have\nbo_crabs = 40\nmonic_crabs = 36\nrani_crabs = 46\n\n# Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together\ntotal_crabs = bo_crabs + monic_crabs + rani_crabs\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and total number of crabs\nprint(\"Bo, Monic, and Rani have a total of \" + str(total_crabs) + \" crabs together.\")\nprint(\"Unit: crabs\")\nprint(\"Final answer as an integer: \" + str(total_crabs))\n```\n\nPlease execute the code and provide the output in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].')",
