So, Janet has\", total_pens, \"pens now.\")\n\n# Print the unit\nprint(\"pens\")\n\n# Print the total number of pens\nprint(total_pens)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the explanation, unit, and total number of pens Janet has now.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Janet had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens.
