The red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Jerry has a flock of chickens, with red chickens producing 3 eggs a day and white chickens producing 5 eggs a day. He collects 42 eggs per day and has two more white chickens than red chickens. We need to find the number of red chickens Jerry has.\n\nLet's denote the number of red chickens as 'r' and the number of white chickens as 'w'. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, we can express the number of white chickens in terms of the number of red chickens as w = r + 2.\n\nThe total number of eggs collected per day is the sum of the eggs produced by the red chickens and the white chickens. Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3r. Similarly, since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5w.\n\nWe are given that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n3r + 5w = 42\n\nSubstituting w = r + 2 into this equation, we get:\n\n3r + 5(r + 2) = 42\n\nNow, we need to simplify this equation.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code to simplify the equation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nr = sp.symbols('r')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = 3*r + 5*(r + 2) - 42\n\n# Simplify the equation\nsimplified_equation = sp.simplify(equation)\n\nprint(simplified_equation)\n```\n\nThis will give us the simplified equation, which we can then solve to find the number of red chickens Jerry has.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The simplified equation is 8r - 32. To find the number of red chickens Jerry has, we need to solve this equation for r. We can do this by setting the equation equal to 0 and solving for r. This gives us 8r - 32 = 0, which can be solved by adding 32 to both sides and then dividing by 8.

Since each red chicken produces 3 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the red chickens is 3r. Similarly, since each white chicken produces 5 eggs a day, the total number of eggs produced by the white chickens is 5w.\n\nWe are given that the total number of eggs collected per day is 42. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n3r + 5w = 42\n\nSubstituting w = r + 2 into this equation, we get:\n\n3r + 5(r + 2) = 42\n\nNow, we need to simplify this equation.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code to simplify the equation:\n\n```python\nimport sympy as sp\n\n# Define the variable\nr = sp.symbols('r')\n\n# Define the equation\nequation = 3*r + 5*(r + 2) - 42\n\n# Simplify the equation\nsimplified_equation = sp.simplify(equation)\n\nprint(simplified_equation)\n```\n\nThis will give us the simplified equation, which we can then solve to find the number of red chickens Jerry has.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The simplified equation is 8r - 32. To find the number of red chickens Jerry has, we need to solve this equation for r. We can do this by setting the equation equal to 0 and solving for r. This gives us 8r - 32 = 0, which can be solved by adding 32 to both sides and then dividing by 8.
