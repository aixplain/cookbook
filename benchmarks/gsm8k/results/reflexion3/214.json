Now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. We need to find the amount of water in the small pool now.\n\nLet's define the initial amount of water in the small pool as x gallons. Since the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, the initial amount of water in the big pool is 2x gallons.\n\nAfter 4 minutes, the amount of water leaked out of the small pool is 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. So, the current amount of water in the small pool is x - 16 gallons.\n\nSimilarly, the amount of water leaked out of the big pool is also 4 * 4 = 16 gallons. So, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons.\n\nAccording to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this information:\n\n2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)\n\nWe need to solve this equation to find the value of x.\n\nYou previously used the python_repl tool to solve this equation and found that the solution is [24]. You also used the python_repl tool to calculate the amount of water in the small pool now based on the solution x = 24 and found that the amount of water in the small pool now is 8 gallons.\n\nNow, we need to write a Python code to provide the final answer in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. \n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to write this code.

So, the current amount of water in the big pool is 2x - 16 gallons.\n\nAccording to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can set up an equation based on this information:\n\n2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)\n\nWe need to solve this equation to find the value of x.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to solve this equation and find the value of x.
