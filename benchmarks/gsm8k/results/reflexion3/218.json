We know that Harriet is 21 years old now, Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet, and Harriet is half the age of Zack. We also know that Harriet's age in three years is 24, Adrian's age in three years is 66, and Zack's age in three years is 45.\n\nUsing this information, we can write a Python code to calculate the average age of the three in three years. Here's the code:\n\n```python\n# Define Harriet's age in three years\nharriet_age_in_three_years = 24\n\n# Define Adrian's age in three years\nadrian_age_in_three_years = 66\n\n# Define Zack's age in three years\nzack_age_in_three_years = 45\n\n# Calculate the sum of their ages in three years\nsum_ages_in_three_years = harriet_age_in_three_years + adrian_age_in_three_years + zack_age_in_three_years\n\n# Calculate the average age of the three in three years\naverage_age_in_three_years = sum_ages_in_three_years / 3\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and final answer\nprint(\"The average age of the three in three years is\", \"years\", int(average_age_in_three_years))\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nCalculate the average age of the three in three years\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
