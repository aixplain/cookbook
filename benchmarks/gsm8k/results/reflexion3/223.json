Now, we need to add this amount to the amount spent on advertising for the first year, which is $15000.\n\nTo do this, we can use simple arithmetic operations in Python. We will first define the amount spent on advertising for the first year and the amount spent on advertising for the second year. Then, we will calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years by adding these two amounts together.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the amount spent on advertising for the first year\nfirst_year_amount = 15000\n\n# Define the amount spent on advertising for the second year\nsecond_year_amount = 5000.0\n\n# Calculate the total amount spent on advertising for the two years\ntotal_amount = first_year_amount + second_year_amount\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and total amount spent on advertising for the two years\nprint(\"The company spent a total of\", total_amount, \"dollars on advertising for the two years.\")\nprint(\"dollars\")\nprint(int(total_amount))\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount spent on advertising for the two years as a list with explanation and unit.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The company spent a total of 20000 dollars on advertising for the two years.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where a company spends $15000 on advertising for a year and then spends a third of that amount on advertising for another year.
