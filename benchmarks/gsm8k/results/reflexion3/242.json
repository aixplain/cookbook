He stopped being penpals with 2 of them.  They each send 2 letters a week that are 5 pages long.  He responds in kind.  He can write a page every 6 minutes.  How many hours does he spend writing a week?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'To calculate the total number of pages Mike writes in a week, we need to first determine the number of pen pals he has left and the number of pages he writes to each of them per week.\n\nSince Mike stopped being pen pals with 2 people, he has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals left. Each pen pal sends him 2 letters a week, and he responds in kind, so he writes 2 letters to each pen pal per week. Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 2 * 5 = 10 pages to each pen pal per week.\n\nSince he has 3 pen pals left, he writes a total of 3 * 10 = 30 pages per week.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pen pals Mike has left\npen_pals = 5 - 2\n\n# Define the number of letters each pen pal sends per week\nletters_per_week = 2\n\n# Define the number of pages per letter\npages_per_letter = 5\n\n# Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week\ntotal_pages = pen_pals * letters_per_week * pages_per_letter\n\nprint(total_pages)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool to get the total number of pages Mike writes per week.\n\nASSIGNMENT:\n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nTASK: Execute the following Python code using the python_repl tool:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pen pals Mike has left\npen_pals = 5 - 2\n\n# Define the number of letters each pen pal sends per week\nletters_per_week = 2\n\n# Define the number of pages per letter\npages_per_letter = 5\n\n# Calculate the total number of pages Mike writes per week\ntotal_pages = pen_pals * letters_per_week * pages_per_letter\n\nprint(total_pages)\n```\n\nPlease provide the output of the code as the total number of pages Mike writes per week.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of pages Mike writes per week is 30.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nTASK: Now that we know Mike writes a total of 30 pages per week, we need to convert this to hours.
