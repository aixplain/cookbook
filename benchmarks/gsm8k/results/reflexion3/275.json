He has to memorize his lines for two scenes and the lyrics to one solo song. His solo song has 54 lines in the lyrics. The first scene has twice the number of lines, but only a third of them are his lines. The second scene has six more lines than the song, and four-fifths of them are his. How many lines does Sean have to memorize?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's, we need to first determine the total number of lines in the first scene and then find one-third of that number.\n\nGiven that the solo song has 54 lines and the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song, we can calculate the total number of lines in the first scene as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of lines in the solo song\nlines_in_song = 54\n\n# Calculate the total number of lines in the first scene\ntotal_lines_in_first_scene = lines_in_song * 2\n```\n\nNow, we need to find one-third of the total number of lines in the first scene to determine the number of lines that are Sean's.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's\nseans_lines_in_first_scene = total_lines_in_first_scene // 3\n```\n\nPlease execute the following code to get the result:\n\n```python\nlines_in_song = 54\ntotal_lines_in_first_scene = lines_in_song * 2\nseans_lines_in_first_scene = total_lines_in_first_scene // 3\nprint(seans_lines_in_first_scene)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's is 36.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of lines in the second scene that are Sean's, we need to first determine the total number of lines in the second scene and then find four-fifths of that number.\n\nGiven that the solo song has 54 lines and the second scene has six more lines than the song, we can calculate the total number of lines in the second scene as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of lines in the solo song\nlines_in_song = 54\n\n# Calculate the total number of lines in the second scene\ntotal_lines_in_second_scene = lines_in_song + 6\n```\n\nNow, we need to find four-fifths of the total number of lines in the second scene to determine the number of lines that are Sean's.\n\n```python\n# Calculate the number of lines in the second scene that are Sean's\nseans_lines_in_second_scene = (total_lines_in_second_scene * 4) // 5\n```\n\nPlease execute the following code to get the result:\n\n```python\nlines_in_song = 54\ntotal_lines_in_second_scene = lines_in_song + 6\nseans_lines_in_second_scene = (total_lines_in_second_scene * 4) // 5\nprint(seans_lines_in_second_scene)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of lines in the second scene that are Sean's.

To get the total number of lines Sean has to memorize, add the number of lines in the solo song (54) and the number of lines in the first scene that are Sean's (36) to the result.
