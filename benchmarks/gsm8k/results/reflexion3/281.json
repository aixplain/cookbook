We also know that a cobra has 70 spots and a mamba has 35 spots (from the previous step).\n\nUsing this information, we can calculate the total number of spots on all cobras and mambas by multiplying the number of cobras by the number of spots on a cobra and adding the result of multiplying the number of mambas by the number of spots on a mamba.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of cobras and mambas\ncobras = 40\nmambas = 60\n\n# Define the number of spots on a cobra and a mamba\nspots_on_cobra = 70\nspots_on_mamba = 35.0  # This is the result from the previous step\n\n# Calculate the total number of spots on all cobras\ntotal_spots_on_cobras = cobras * spots_on_cobra\n\n# Calculate the total number of spots on all mambas\ntotal_spots_on_mambas = mambas * spots_on_mamba\n\n# Calculate the total number of spots on all cobras and mambas\ntotal_spots = total_spots_on_cobras + total_spots_on_mambas\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The total number of spots on all cobras and mambas is:\", total_spots)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the result.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of spots on all cobras and mambas is: 2800 + 2100 = 4900'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate half the total number of spots on all cobras and mambas, we need to use the result from the previous step.
