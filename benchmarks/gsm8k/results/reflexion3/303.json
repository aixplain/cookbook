We also need to consider the 50 unsold books and the initial 250 books.\n\nWe know that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year. Since her sales number this year is 45, we calculated the number of books sold in the first year as 90. We also know that there are currently 50 unsold books and her sales number this year is 45.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the initial number of books\ninitial_books = 250\n\n# Define the number of books sold in the current year\ncurrent_year_sales = 45\n\n# Define the number of unsold books\nunsold_books = 50\n\n# Calculate the number of books sold in the first year\nfirst_year_sales = 2 * current_year_sales\n\n# Calculate the total number of books sold in the first two years\ntotal_books_sold = initial_books - unsold_books - current_year_sales\n\n# Calculate the number of books sold in the second year\nsecond_year_sales = total_books_sold - first_year_sales\n\nprint(second_year_sales)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of books sold in the second year. Please execute this code and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of books sold in the second year is 65.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year, we need to multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price of each book. We know that each book sells at 20$ and we calculated the number of books sold in the second year as 65.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the price of each book\nbook_price = 20\n\n# Define the number of books sold in the second year\nsecond_year_sales = 65\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money earned in the second year\ntotal_amount_earned = second_year_sales * book_price\n\nprint(\"The total amount of money earned in the second year is\", total_amount_earned, \"dollars.\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount of money earned in the second year.
