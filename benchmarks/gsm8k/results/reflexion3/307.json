    "question": "Sandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?",

If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, how many weeks will it take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight?",
        "output": "To calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we need to divide the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the weight Joey loses per week and then multiply by the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week.\n\nExplanation: \nSandy wants to lose as much weight as Joey does but needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, we can calculate the weight Joey loses per week by dividing the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks by the number of weeks. This gives us 2.0 pounds per week. Since Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week, we can calculate the number of weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey by multiplying the number of weeks it takes Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey loses in a week by the total weight Joey loses in 4 weeks and then dividing by the weight Joey loses per week.\n\nUnit: weeks\nFinal answer as an integer: 16",
