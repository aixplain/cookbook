To find the total number of pencils they have, we simply need to add the number of pencils Jam has to the number of pencils Meg has.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the total number of pencils:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pencils Jam and Meg have\npencils_jam = 26\npencils_meg = 46\n\n# Calculate the total number of pencils\ntotal_pencils = pencils_jam + pencils_meg\n\nprint(\"The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have is:\", total_pencils)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of pencils Jam and Meg have is 72.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT: Calculate the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils.\n\nWe already know that Jam and Meg have a total of 72 pencils. We also know that each box contains 8 pencils (from INTERMEDIATE STEP 1). To find the number of boxes needed to store all the pencils, we simply need to divide the total number of pencils by the number of pencils in each box.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the number of boxes needed:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of pencils and the number of pencils in each box\ntotal_pencils = 72\npencils_per_box = 8\n\n# Calculate the number of boxes needed\nboxes_needed = total_pencils // pencils_per_box\n\n# Check if there are any remaining pencils that won't fit in a box\nremaining_pencils = total_pencils % pencils_per_box\n\n# If there are remaining pencils, we need one more box to store them\nif remaining_pencils > 0:\n    boxes_needed += 1\n\nprint(\"The number of boxes needed to store all the pencils is:\", boxes_needed)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of boxes needed to store all the pencils is 9.'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the final answer as an integer\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
