Please use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total value of all shares after the second year\ntotal_value = 72.0\n\n# Print the explanation\nprint(\"The final value of all Maria's shares is $72.0\")\n\n# Print the unit\nprint(\"The unit is dollars\")\n\n# Print the final answer as an integer\nprint(int(total_value))\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the final answer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The final value of all Maria's shares is $72.0.
