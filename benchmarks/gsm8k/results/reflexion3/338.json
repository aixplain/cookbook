We need to find the number of students in the smallest group.\n\nTo start, let's define the equation to represent the total number of students. Let's assume the number of students in the two equal groups is x. Then, the number of students in the smallest group is x - 10.\n\nSince the total number of students is 200, we can set up the equation:\n\n2x + (x - 10) = 200\n\nWe need to solve this equation to find the value of x.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code to define the equation:\n\n```python\n# Define the equation\ndef equation(x):\n    return 2*x + (x - 10) - 200\n\n# Print the equation\nprint(\"Equation: 3x - 10 - 200 = 0\")\n```\n\nPlease provide the output of the equation.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The equation to represent the total number of students is 3x - 10 - 200 = 0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where a class of 200 students is split into 3 groups.
