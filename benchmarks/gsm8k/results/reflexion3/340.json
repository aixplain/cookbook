The total number of balls Josh has after 4 weeks of practice should be calculated by adding the initial number of balls (3) to the number of weeks practiced (4), but since Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week, the correct calculation should be the initial number of balls (3) plus the number of weeks practiced (4), but since he adds one ball per week, the correct formula should be initial_balls + (weeks_practiced), but since he adds one ball per week, the correct formula should be initial_balls + weeks_practiced. However, this is not entirely correct since Josh starts with 3 balls and adds one ball per week for 4 weeks. The correct formula should be initial_balls + weeks_practiced, but since he starts with 3 and adds one ball per week for 4 weeks, the correct formula should be initial_balls + weeks_practiced - 1 + weeks_practiced or simply initial_balls + weeks_practiced + weeks_practiced - 1 or simply initial_balls + weeks_practiced + 3 or simply 3 + 4 + 3 or simply 3 + 4 * 1 or simply 3 + 1 * 4 or simply 7.
