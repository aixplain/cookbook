Let's use this information to calculate the total time John spent on all activities.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python commands:\n\n```python\n# Define the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows\ntime_spent_on_activities = 15\n\n# Define the percentage of time spent on these activities\npercentage_of_time_spent_on_activities = 30\n\n# Calculate the total time spent on all activities\ntotal_time = time_spent_on_activities / (percentage_of_time_spent_on_activities / 100)\n\n# Print the total time spent on all activities\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\nPlease execute the above python commands and provide the output as the total time spent on all activities.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total time John spent on all activities is 50 hours.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the time John spent sightseeing, we need to use the information provided about the total time John spent on all activities, which is 50 hours, and the percentage of time spent on sightseeing, which is 40%.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python commands:\n\n```python\n# Define the total time spent on all activities\ntotal_time = 50\n\n# Define the percentage of time spent on sightseeing\npercentage_of_time_spent_on_sightseeing = 40\n\n# Calculate the time spent on sightseeing\ntime_spent_on_sightseeing = total_time * (percentage_of_time_spent_on_sightseeing / 100)\n\n# Print the time spent on sightseeing\nprint(time_spent_on_sightseeing)\n```\n\nPlease execute the above python commands and provide the output as the time spent on sightseeing.
