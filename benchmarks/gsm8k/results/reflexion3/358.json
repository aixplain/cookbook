She buys 4 lollipops worth 25 cents each every day and saves the change in her piggy bank. How much money does she put in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days?\nFEEDBACK: The explanation provided in the response is incorrect. The correct explanation should be \"Marisa saves $1.5 every day and she saves for 5 days, so she puts a total of\" and the final answer should be 15, but the unit should be dollars and the final answer should be 15 not 0.15.\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the daily savings, we need to subtract the cost of lollipops from the pocket money. \n\nFirst, let's define the variables:\n- pocket_money: the amount of money Marisa gets every day\n- cost_per_lollipop: the cost of each lollipop\n- number_of_lollipops: the number of lollipops Marisa buys every day\n\nThen, we can calculate the total cost of lollipops and the daily savings.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the variables\npocket_money = 5  # in dollars\ncost_per_lollipop = 0.25  # in dollars\nnumber_of_lollipops = 4\n\n# Convert the pocket money to cents\npocket_money_cents = pocket_money * 100\n\n# Calculate the total cost of lollipops in cents\ntotal_cost_lollipops_cents = cost_per_lollipop * number_of_lollipops * 100\n\n# Calculate the daily savings in cents\ndaily_savings_cents = pocket_money_cents - total_cost_lollipops_cents\n\n# Print the daily savings in cents\nprint(daily_savings_cents)\n```\n\nThis will give us the daily savings in cents.
