        "output": "[Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]: \nCarver is 45 years old, which is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. To find the age of his son, we can define an equation based on the given information. Let's assume the age of Carver's son is x. Since Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son, we can write the equation as 2x - 5 = 45. Solving this equation for x, we get x = 25. Therefore, the age of Carver's son is 25 years.\nyears, 25",
