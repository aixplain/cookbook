If a total of 50 people were kicked out of Walmart, we need to calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting as 87 and the number of customers kicked out for physical violence as 261. However, we realized that the total number of customers kicked out for physical violence (261) plus the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks (23) and the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting (87) exceeds the total number of customers kicked out (50). This indicates an error in our previous calculations.\n\nTo correct this, we need to recalculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting and physical violence. We will start by defining the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as 23. Then, we will calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting by multiplying the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks by 4 and subtracting 5.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks\nmask_refusal = 23\n\n# Calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting\nshoplifting = 4 * mask_refusal - 5\n\n# Calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence\nphysical_violence = 3 * shoplifting\n\n# Calculate the total number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, shoplifting, and physical violence\ntotal_customers = mask_refusal + shoplifting + physical_violence\n\n# Since total_customers exceeds 50, we need to re-evaluate the calculations\n# Let's assume the number of customers kicked out for physical violence is x\n# Then, the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting is x/3\n# The number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks is 23\n# The total number of customers kicked out is 50\n# So, we can set up the equation: 23 + x/3 + x = 50\n\n# Solve the equation for x\nx = 27 / 4 * 3\n\n# Calculate the number of customers kicked out for physical violence\nphysical_violence = x\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is\", physical_violence)\n```\n\nThis will give us the correct number of customers kicked out for physical violence.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of customers kicked out for physical violence is 20.25'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nCalculate the number of customers kicked out for other reasons\n\nASSIGNMENT:",

If a total of 50 people were kicked out of Walmart, we need to calculate the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting.\n\nTo do this, we can start by defining the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks as 23.
