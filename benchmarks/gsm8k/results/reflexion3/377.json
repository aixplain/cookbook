    "question": "Lucy sells apples from her orchard at $4 per piece. On Monday, she sold all the apples picked. On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, how many apples did she pick over the three days?",

Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, we can calculate the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she earned on Monday ($56) by the price per apple ($4). This gives us 14 apples. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked 12 and 24 apples respectively. Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples. \napples, 50",

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples. Come Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she did the previous day. If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, we can calculate the number of apples she picked on Monday by dividing the total amount she earned on Monday ($56) by the price per apple ($4). This gives us 14 apples. On Tuesday and Wednesday, she picked 12 and 24 apples respectively. Therefore, the total number of apples picked over the three days is 14 + 12 + 24 = 50 apples. \napples, 50",
