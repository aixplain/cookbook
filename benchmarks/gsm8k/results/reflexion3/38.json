We can directly use this information to provide the total distance.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total distance John runs in a week\ntotal_distance = 60\n\n# Print the total distance\nprint(\"The total distance John runs in a week is\", total_distance, \"miles\")\n```\n\nThis will output the total distance John runs in a week.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total distance John runs in a week is 60 miles'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total time John takes to run in a week, we need to use the given information.
