We will use this value in the next step to calculate the number of bags of flour Mark needs to buy.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount of flour required for a quadruple batch of brownies is 12.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies, we need to multiply the amount of milk required for a normal batch by 4.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the amount of milk required for a normal batch\nmilk_per_batch = 1\n\n# Calculate the total amount of milk required for a quadruple batch\ntotal_milk = milk_per_batch * 4\n\n# Print the total amount of milk required\nprint(total_milk)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount of milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies. We will use this value in the next step to calculate the number of bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.\n\nNote: We already know that the total amount of flour required for a quadruple batch of brownies is 12.

We will use this value in the next step to calculate the difference between the number of bags of flour and the number of bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.\n\nNote: We also know that the total amount of milk required for a quadruple batch of brownies is 4 cups, and that milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.
