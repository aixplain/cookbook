Since Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, the new daily usage is 3 hours a day. The new daily energy usage is 900 watts/hour * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day.\n\nTo calculate the total energy used in 30 days with the reduced usage, we can multiply the new daily energy usage by 30.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the new daily energy usage in kWh\nnew_daily_energy_usage = 2.7\n\n# Calculate the total energy used in 30 days with the reduced usage\ntotal_energy_used_reduced = new_daily_energy_usage * 30\n\n# Print the total energy used with the reduced usage\nprint(total_energy_used_reduced)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days when the time is reduced by 5 hours a day.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days when the time is reduced by 5 hours a day is 81.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the energy saved by reducing the usage of the air conditioner by 5 hours a day, we need to subtract the total energy used with the reduced usage from the total energy used.\n\nWe have already calculated the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days, which is 216.0 kWh. We have also calculated the total energy used by the air conditioner in 30 days when the time is reduced by 5 hours a day, which is 81.0 kWh.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total energy used in 30 days\ntotal_energy_used = 216.0\n\n# Define the total energy used in 30 days with the reduced usage\ntotal_energy_used_reduced = 81.0\n\n# Calculate the energy saved\nenergy_saved = total_energy_used - total_energy_used_reduced\n\n# Print the energy saved\nprint(energy_saved)\n```\n\nThis will give us the energy saved by reducing the usage of the air conditioner by 5 hours a day. Please provide the output of the code execution.\n\nAlso, please note that the final answer should be in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. For example, if the energy saved is 135.0 kWh, the final answer should be \"Mel saves 135.0 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days, kilowatt-hours, 135\".'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Mel saves 135.0 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days, kilowatt-hours, 135'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nConvert the energy saved from watt-hours to kilowatt-hours and return the final answer\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
