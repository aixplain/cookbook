Toby can read at a rate of 300 words per minute. He has to be at the airport in 60 minutes and plans to leave as soon as he finishes the book. It takes 10 minutes to get to the airport.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the total number of words in the book, which is 9000, the time it takes Toby to read the book, which is 30.0 minutes, the time Toby has available before he needs to leave for the airport, which is 20.0 minutes, and the time Toby will be early, which is 10.0 minutes.\n\nTo calculate the difference between the time Toby has available and the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport, we need to subtract the time it takes Toby to read the book and the time it takes to get to the airport from the total time available.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_time_available = 60\ntime_to_get_to_airport = 10\ntime_to_read_book = 30.0\n\n# Calculate the difference between the time Toby has available and the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport\ntime_difference = total_time_available - time_to_get_to_airport - time_to_read_book\n\n# Print the result\nprint(time_difference)\n```\n\nThis will give us the difference between the time Toby has available and the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport.

We also calculated this difference in the previous step, which is 20.0 minutes.\n\nBut the question asks for the difference between the time Toby has available and the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport. Since Toby has 20 minutes available before he needs to leave for the airport and it takes him 40 minutes to read the book and get to the airport, the correct answer should be -20, but in the context of the problem, Toby will be late by 20 minutes.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_time_available = 60\ntime_to_get_to_airport = 10\ntime_to_read_book = 30.0\n\n# Calculate the difference between the time Toby has available and the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport\ntime_difference = total_time_available - (time_to_get_to_airport + time_to_read_book)\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Toby will be late by\", int(abs(time_difference)), \"minutes\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the correct difference between the time Toby has available and the time it takes him to read the book and get to the airport.
