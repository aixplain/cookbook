The finale firework costs $150. To do this, you can use simple addition. You can add the cost of the finale firework to the discounted total cost of the two packages of fireworks.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the discounted total cost of the two packages\ndiscounted_total_cost_packages = 960\n\n# Define the cost of the finale firework\ncost_finale_firework = 150\n\n# Calculate the total cost\ntotal_cost = discounted_total_cost_packages + cost_finale_firework\n\n# Print the total cost\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nThis will give you the total cost of the two packages of fireworks and the finale firework.",

The first package costs $400, and the second package costs twice as much as the first one. You need to calculate the cost of the second package of fireworks.\n\nTo do this, you can use simple multiplication. Since the second package costs twice as much as the first one, you can multiply the cost of the first package by 2.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of the first package\ncost_first_package = 400\n\n# Calculate the cost of the second package\ncost_second_package = cost_first_package * 2\n\n# Print the cost of the second package\nprint(cost_second_package)\n```\n\nThis will give you the cost of the second package of fireworks.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The cost of the second package of fireworks is 800 dollars.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Tim buys two packages of fireworks and a finale firework.

To do this, you can use simple multiplication and subtraction.
