The problem states that there are 180 heads and 304 bumps in total. We know that camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each. We need to define the coefficients of the linear equations to represent this problem.\n\nLet's denote the number of camels as 'c' and the number of dromedaries as 'd'. We can set up two equations based on the given information:\n\n1. The total number of heads (camels and dromedaries) is 180.\n2. The total number of bumps (humps) is 304.\n\nWe can represent these equations as:\n\nc + d = 180 (Equation 1)\n2c + d = 304 (Equation 2)\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please define the coefficients of these linear equations. \n\nPlease execute the following python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the coefficients of the linear equations\nA = [[1, 1], [2, 1]]  # coefficients of c and d in both equations\nb = [180, 304]  # constants on the right side of the equations\n\nprint(\"Coefficients of the linear equations:\")\nprint(\"A =\", A)\nprint(\"b =\", b)\n```\n\nThis will output the coefficients of the linear equations, which we will use in the next step to solve for the number of camels and dromedaries.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The coefficients of the linear equations are A = [[1, 1], [2, 1]] and b = [180, 304].'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem involving a herd of camels and dromedaries.
