    "question": "Cole wanted to buy new jeans for a dance contest. At the store, he couldn't decide between tattered jeans and jogger jeans. Since the jeans were on sale, he decided to buy them both. The tattered jeans cost $28 while the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. He saved a total of $6. If he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, how much more do jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans?",

Since Cole saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans, and he saved a total of $6, we can calculate the discount amount for the tattered jeans.\n\nWe know that the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Let's denote the original price of the tattered jeans as x and the original price of the jogger jeans as 22 (calculated in the previous step).\n\nSince the jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we can write an equation:\n\nx - 6 = 22\n\nWe can use the python_repl tool to calculate the value of x.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the original price of the jogger jeans\njogger_jeans_price = 22\n\n# Calculate the original price of the tattered jeans\ntattered_jeans_price = jogger_jeans_price + 6\n\n# Print the original price of the tattered jeans\nprint(tattered_jeans_price)\n```\n\nThis will give us the original price of the tattered jeans.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The original price of the tattered jeans is $28.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the difference between the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans, we need to subtract the original price of the jogger jeans from the original price of the tattered jeans.\n\nWe have already calculated the original prices of the jogger jeans and the tattered jeans in the previous steps.
