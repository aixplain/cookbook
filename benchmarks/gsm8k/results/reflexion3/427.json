He has a collection of cards and plans to sell them for $1.5 each. He keeps 1/3 of them and gets to go to the amusement park with $50 in spending cash. How many cards did he start with?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of money Kenny earned from selling his cards, we need to first determine the amount of money he had after selling the cards and before going to the amusement park. We know that he had $50 in spending cash and that the ticket to the amusement park costs $100. \n\nSince he had $50 in spending cash, that means he had $100 (ticket cost) + $50 (spending cash) = $150 after selling the cards.\n\nWe also know that he sold 2/3 of his cards, since he kept 1/3 of them.\n\nLet's denote the total number of cards as x. Then, the number of cards he sold is 2/3 * x.\n\nSince he sold each card for $1.5, the total amount of money he earned from selling the cards is 1.5 * (2/3 * x).\n\nHowever, we already know that he had $150 after selling the cards. So, we can set up the equation:\n\n1.5 * (2/3 * x) = 150\n\nTo solve for x, we can use the python_repl tool. \n\nHere is the python command to calculate the total amount of money Kenny earned from selling his cards:\n\n```python\n# Given values\ntotal_money_after_selling = 150\nprice_per_card = 1.5\nfraction_of_cards_sold = 2/3\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money Kenny earned from selling his cards\ntotal_money_from_selling = total_money_after_selling\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The total amount of money Kenny earned from selling his cards is: \", total_money_from_selling)\n```\n\nPlease execute this python command using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount of money Kenny earned from selling his cards is $150.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of cards Kenny sold, we need to use the information we have gathered so far. We know that Kenny earned $150 from selling his cards, and that he sold each card for $1.5. We also know that he sold 2/3 of his total cards.\n\nWe can use the equation we set up earlier:\n\n1.5 * (2/3 * x) = 150\n\nWhere x is the total number of cards Kenny had.\n\nWe can simplify this equation to solve for x:\n\n(2/3 * x) = 150 / 1.5\n(2/3 * x) = 100\nx = 100 * (3/2)\nx = 150\n\nSo, Kenny had a total of 150 cards.\n\nSince he sold 2/3 of his cards, we can calculate the number of cards he sold as follows:\n\nnumber_of_cards_sold = (2/3) * 150\nnumber_of_cards_sold = 100\n\nHere is the python command to calculate the number of cards Kenny sold:\n\n```python\n# Given values\ntotal_money_after_selling = 150\nprice_per_card = 1.5\nfraction_of_cards_sold = 2/3\n\n# Calculate the total number of cards Kenny had\ntotal_number_of_cards = 150\n\n# Calculate the number of cards Kenny sold\nnumber_of_cards_sold = (2/3) * total_number_of_cards\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The number of cards Kenny sold is: \", number_of_cards_sold)\n```\n\nPlease execute this python command using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of cards Kenny sold is 100.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of cards Kenny started with, we need to use the information we have gathered so far.
