To calculate the perimeter of the room in feet, we need to first convert the length from yards to feet, then calculate the width, and finally calculate the perimeter.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, write a Python command to return the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer.\n\nHere's a sample code to get you started:\n\n```python\n# define the area in square feet\narea = 360\n\n# define the length in yards\nlength_yards = 3\n\n# define the conversion factor (1 yard = 3 feet)\nyards_to_feet = 3\n\n# calculate the length in feet\nlength_feet = length_yards * yards_to_feet\n\n# calculate the width in feet\nwidth = area / length_feet\n\n# calculate the perimeter in feet\nperimeter = 2 * (length_feet + width)\n\n# define the explanation\nexplanation = \"The perimeter of Billie's rectangular bedroom is calculated by adding the length and width and multiplying by 2.\"\n\n# define the unit\nunit = \"feet\"\n\n# define the final answer as an integer\nfinal_answer = int(perimeter)\n\n# print the results\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the answer.",
