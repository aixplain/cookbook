She uses 4 dozen eggs that were in cases and another 2 eggs that were loose in the cupboard. We have already calculated the total number of eggs Rozanne has, which is 50. We also know that each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs and that Rozanne can make a total of 10 glasses of eggnog. We also know that each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog and that Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.\n\nWe need to return the final answer as an integer.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can return the final answer as an integer.\n\nPlease execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the final answer\nfinal_answer = 2\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(final_answer)\n```",
