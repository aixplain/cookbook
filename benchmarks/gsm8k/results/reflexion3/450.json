We need to calculate the regular price of popcorn.\n\nWe already know that the cost of the popcorn and soda is $9, and the cost of the popcorn is $6. We also know that the cost of the movie ticket is $12 and the cost of the super ticket is $20 with a $1 extra charge for the popcorn and soda.\n\nTo determine the regular price of popcorn, we can compare the two costs and use the given savings. Since the user saved $2 by not buying the super ticket, we can calculate the regular price of popcorn by subtracting the cost of the soda from the total cost of the popcorn and soda.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the cost of the popcorn and soda\npopcorn_and_soda_cost = 9\n\n# Define the cost of the soda\nsoda_cost = 3\n\n# Calculate the regular price of popcorn\nregular_price_popcorn = popcorn_and_soda_cost - soda_cost\n\nprint(\"The regular price of popcorn is: \", regular_price_popcorn)\n```\n\nThis will give us the regular price of popcorn. We can then use this value to provide the final answer in the required format.",
