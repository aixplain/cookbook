We also calculated that the number of fairies remaining after 30 fairies flew away is 45.\n\nWe now need to return the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]. The explanation should describe the calculation of the number of fairies remaining. The unit should be \"fairies\". The final answer as an integer should be 45.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of fairies Katelyn saw\nfairies_katelyn_saw = 50\n\n# Define the number of fairies that joined from the east\nfairies_joined_from_east = 25\n\n# Define the total number of fairies after the new fairies joined\ntotal_fairies = fairies_katelyn_saw + fairies_joined_from_east\n\n# Define the number of fairies that flew away\nfairies_flew_away = 30\n\n# Calculate the number of fairies remaining\nfairies_remaining = total_fairies - fairies_flew_away\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The explanation is: Katelyn saw 50 fairies, then 25 more fairies joined, making a total of 75 fairies. After 30 fairies flew away, there were 45 fairies remaining.\")\nprint(\"The unit is: fairies\")\nprint(\"The final answer as an integer is: \", fairies_remaining)\n```",
