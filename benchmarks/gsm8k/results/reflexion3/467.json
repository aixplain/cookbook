Each room has two sheets, one comforter, twice as many pillow cases as sheets and twice as many towels as pillow cases. We need to calculate the total number of pieces of laundry in 80 rooms.\n\nIn the previous steps, we defined the number of rooms and the number of each laundry item per room. The output was:\n\nThe number of rooms is 80, the number of sheets per room is 2, the number of comforters per room is 1, the number of pillow cases per room is 4, and the number of towels per room is 8.\n\nWe also calculated the total number of sheets in all rooms, which is 160, the total number of comforters in all rooms, which is 80, the total number of pillow cases in all rooms, which is 320, and the total number of towels in all rooms, which is 640.\n\nAs the next step, we need to calculate the total number of laundry pieces in all rooms.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of rooms\nrooms = 80\n\n# Define the number of each laundry item per room\nsheets_per_room = 2\ncomforters_per_room = 1\npillow_cases_per_room = sheets_per_room * 2\ntowels_per_room = pillow_cases_per_room * 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of sheets in all rooms\ntotal_sheets = rooms * sheets_per_room\n\n# Calculate the total number of comforters in all rooms\ntotal_comforters = rooms * comforters_per_room\n\n# Calculate the total number of pillow cases in all rooms\ntotal_pillow_cases = rooms * pillow_cases_per_room\n\n# Calculate the total number of towels in all rooms\ntotal_towels = rooms * towels_per_room\n\n# Calculate the total number of laundry pieces in all rooms\ntotal_laundry_pieces = total_sheets + total_comforters + total_pillow_cases + total_towels\n\n# Print the total number of laundry pieces\nprint(\"Total number of laundry pieces in all rooms:\", total_laundry_pieces)\n```\n\nThis will output the total number of laundry pieces in all rooms. We will use this value to provide the final answer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of laundry pieces in all rooms is 1200.'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
