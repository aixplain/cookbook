The weight of the 1959 penny is given as 48 grains, and the weight of the 2010 penny was calculated in the previous step as 36.0 grains.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the combined weight as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the weight of the 1959 penny\nweight_1959 = 48\n\n# Define the weight of the 2010 penny\nweight_2010 = 36.0\n\n# Calculate the combined weight by adding the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny\ncombined_weight = weight_1959 + weight_2010\n\n# Print the combined weight\nprint(combined_weight)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the combined weight of the two pennies, we need to add the weight of the 2010 penny to the weight of the 1959 penny.
