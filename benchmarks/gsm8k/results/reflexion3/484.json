Your task is to return the answer in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].\n\nTo do this, you can use Python to return the answer in the required format. Please use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of oranges Stetson ate\noranges_eaten = 24\n\n# Define the amount of money Stetson gives up per orange\nmoney_per_orange = 10\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up\ntotal_money_given_up = oranges_eaten * money_per_orange\n\n# Return the answer in the required format\nprint([f\"Stetson gave up a total of\", \"dollars\", total_money_given_up])\n```\n\nThis will give you the total amount of money Stetson gave up in the required format. Please provide the output as the final answer.",
