However, the first venue does not include food, which Mark estimates will cost $5 for each person who attends.  At the second venue, food for each guest is already included in the price.  How many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Mark needs to choose between two venues for a surprise party. The first venue charges a flat fee of $200, regardless of the number of guests, but does not include food, which costs $5 per person. The second venue charges $25 per person, including food. We need to find out how many guests are necessary for the two venues to be equal in cost.\n\nTo start, we need to define the cost functions for each venue. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please define two functions: `cost_venue1` and `cost_venue2`. The `cost_venue1` function should take the number of guests as an argument and return the total cost for the first venue, including the flat fee and the cost of food. The `cost_venue2` function should also take the number of guests as an argument and return the total cost for the second venue.\n\nHere is the code to define these functions:\n\n```python\ndef cost_venue1(guests):\n    flat_fee = 200\n    food_cost_per_guest = 5\n    return flat_fee + guests * food_cost_per_guest\n\ndef cost_venue2(guests):\n    cost_per_guest = 25\n    return guests * cost_per_guest\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and confirm that the functions are defined correctly.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The functions `cost_venue1` and `cost_venue2` have been defined correctly. The `cost_venue1` function takes the number of guests as an argument and returns the total cost for the first venue, including the flat fee and the cost of food.
