To fix this, the backslashes should be removed or replaced with a single backslash. However, since the code is supposed to be executed in a specific environment, it's possible that the environment is modifying the code and adding the extra backslashes. The correct code should look like this: \n# Define the cost of the first glass\ncost_first_glass = 5\n\n# Calculate the discounted cost of every second glass\ndiscounted_cost_second_glass = cost_first_glass * 0.6\n\n# Print the results\nprint(\"Cost of the first glass: $\", cost_first_glass)\nprint(\"Discounted cost of every second glass: $\", discounted_cost_second_glass)\nThe output of the correct code would be:\nCost of the first glass: $ 5\nDiscounted cost of every second glass: $ 3.0'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total cost of 16 glasses, we need to use Python to perform the necessary calculations.
