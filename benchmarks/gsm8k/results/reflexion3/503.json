To do this, we need to multiply the width of the rug by 2 and then add 2 feet.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code to calculate the length of the couch:\n\n```python\n# Define the width of the rug\nrug_width = 8\n\n# Calculate twice the width of the rug\ntwice_rug_width = rug_width * 2\n\n# Define the additional length of the couch\ncouch_additional_length = 2\n\n# Calculate the length of the couch\ncouch_length = twice_rug_width + couch_additional_length\n\n# Print the length of the couch\nprint(couch_length)\n```\n\nThis will give us the length of the couch, which we can use to provide the final answer.
