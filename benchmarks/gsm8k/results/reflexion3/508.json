To calculate the number of sheep at the farm, we need to divide the number of sheep at the zoo by 2.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of sheep at the zoo\nsheep_at_zoo = 20\n\n# Calculate the number of sheep at the farm\nsheep_at_farm = sheep_at_zoo / 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(sheep_at_farm)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of sheep at the farm. We will use this result in the next step to calculate the total number of animals at the farm and zoo combined.\n\nPlease note that we already know the number of cows at the farm (30) and the number of cows at the zoo (60). We will use these values along with the result from this step to calculate the total number of animals in the next step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given that the zoo has 20 sheep and the farm has half as many sheep as the zoo does.
