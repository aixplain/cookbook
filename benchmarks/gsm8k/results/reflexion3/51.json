He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back?\nFEEDBACK: The response should be in the format [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]. The unit should be provided only once. The correct response should be: [It takes Tom hours, 5].\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the time Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM in hours, we need to determine the duration of his trip. Since we know the start and end times, we can calculate the time difference.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the start and end times\nstart_time = 1\nend_time = 4\n\n# Calculate the time difference in hours\ntime_difference = end_time - start_time\n\nprint(\"Time difference:\", time_difference)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the time difference between 1 PM and 4 PM, which will give us the time Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM in hours. Please execute this code and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The time Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM, we need to use the formula distance = speed * time. We already know the time difference between 1 PM and 4 PM, which is 3 hours. We also know Tom's speed, which is 10 miles per hour.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the speed and time\nspeed = 10  # miles per hour\ntime_difference = 3  # hours\n\n# Calculate the distance using the formula distance = speed * time\ndistance = speed * time_difference\n\nprint(\"Distance:\", distance)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM using the formula distance = speed * time. Please execute this code and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM is 30 miles.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the time it takes Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 mph, we need to use the formula time = distance / speed. We already know the distance Tom travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is 30 miles. We also know Tom's speed when traveling back, which is 6 miles per hour.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the distance and speed\ndistance = 30  # miles\nspeed = 6  # miles per hour\n\n# Calculate the time using the formula time = distance / speed\ntime = distance / speed\n\nprint(\"Time to travel back:\", time)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the time it takes Tom to travel back at a rate of 6 mph using the formula time = distance / speed. Please execute this code and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, please format the final answer as [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].
