We have previously calculated the total cost of the canvas bags to be $160 and the total revenue from selling the canvas bags to be $320. We also calculated the profit earned by Tara to be $160.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code to format the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]:\n\n```python\n# Define the profit and unit\nprofit = 160\nunit = \"dollars\"\n\n# Format the answer\nanswer = f\"Tara earned a profit of ${profit}, {unit}, {profit}\"\n\n# Print the answer\nprint(answer)\n```\n\nPlease provide the output of the answer as the final response.",
