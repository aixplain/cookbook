        "output": "Explanation: \nOphelia and Jenna are living in the same apartment building. They each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs. Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia. If Ophelia has 20 sofas, we can calculate the number of chairs Ophelia has by adding 2 to the number of sofas she has. Then, we can calculate the number of chairs Jenna has by multiplying the number of chairs Ophelia has by 3. After that, we can calculate the number of sofas Jenna has by subtracting 2 from the number of chairs she has. Finally, we can calculate the total number of sofas and chairs they have by adding the number of sofas and chairs Ophelia has to the number of sofas and chairs Jenna has.\n\nUnit: \nPieces of furniture\n\nFinal Answer: \n184",
