    "question": "A mechanic charges different rates to repair the tires of trucks and cars.  For each truck tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $60 and for each car tire that is repaired, the mechanic will charge $40.

Please provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The revenue earned on Thursday is 520.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the revenue earned on Friday, we need to multiply the number of car tires repaired by the rate per car tire, since no truck tires were repaired on Friday.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the rates per tire\ntruck_tire_rate = 60\ncar_tire_rate = 40\n\n# Define the number of tires repaired on Thursday\ntruck_tires_repaired_thursday = 6\ncar_tires_repaired_thursday = 4\n\n# Calculate the revenue earned on Thursday\nrevenue_thursday = (truck_tires_repaired_thursday * truck_tire_rate) + (car_tires_repaired_thursday * car_tire_rate)\n\n# Define the number of tires repaired on Friday\ntruck_tires_repaired_friday = 0\ncar_tires_repaired_friday = 12\n\n# Calculate the revenue earned on Friday\nrevenue_friday = (truck_tires_repaired_friday * truck_tire_rate) + (car_tires_repaired_friday * car_tire_rate)\n\n# Print the revenue earned on Friday\nprint(\"Revenue earned on Friday:\", revenue_friday)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the revenue earned on Friday and print the result. Please provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The revenue earned on Friday is 480.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo find the difference between the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday, we need to subtract the revenue earned on Friday from the revenue earned on Thursday.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the revenue earned on Thursday\nrevenue_thursday = 520\n\n# Define the revenue earned on Friday\nrevenue_friday = 480\n\n# Calculate the difference between the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday\ndifference = revenue_thursday - revenue_friday\n\n# Print the difference\nprint(\"The difference between the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday is:\", difference)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the difference between the revenues earned on Thursday and Friday and print the result. Please provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, please provide the explanation as the first part of the output in the following format:\n\n\"The mechanic earned $X more on Thursday than on Friday, dollars, Y\"\n\nWhere X is the difference and Y is the final answer as an integer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'40'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nDetermine the day with higher revenue and calculate the difference\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
