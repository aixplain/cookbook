We also know that the daily savings in the second half is $50.00 and the number of days in the first half of April is 15.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the daily savings Elvis needs to make in the first half of the month.\n\nFirst, calculate the total savings Elvis needs to make in the second half of the month. Since the daily savings in the second half is $50.00 and the number of days in the second half is 15, the total savings in the second half will be 15 * 50 = 750.\n\nThe total savings for the month is the sum of the savings in the first half and the second half, which is 1125. So the total savings in the first half will be 1125 - 750 = 375.\n\nSince the number of days in the first half is 15, the daily savings in the first half will be 375 / 15.\n\n```python\n# Define the monthly saving target\nmonthly_target = 1125\n\n# Define the daily savings in the second half\ndaily_savings_second_half = 50\n\n# Define the number of days in the first half of April\ndays_in_first_half = 15\n\n# Calculate the total savings in the second half\ntotal_savings_second_half = daily_savings_second_half * days_in_first_half\n\n# Calculate the total savings in the first half\ntotal_savings_first_half = monthly_target - total_savings_second_half\n\n# Calculate the daily savings in the first half\ndaily_savings_first_half = total_savings_first_half / days_in_first_half\n\n# Print the daily savings Elvis needs to make in the first half\nprint(daily_savings_first_half)\n```\n\nPlease execute the above code and provide the output.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The daily savings Elvis needs to make in the first half of the month is $25.00.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 5:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the final answer, we need to determine the daily savings Elvis needs to make in the second half of April and provide the explanation and unit.\n\nYou are given that Elvis has a monthly saving target of $1125 and that he wants to save twice as much daily in the second half as he saves in the first half.
