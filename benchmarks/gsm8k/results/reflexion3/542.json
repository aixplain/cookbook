We need to return the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the total cost of the apples, which is $4.50, the total cost of the oranges, which is $4.00, and the total cost of the peaches, which is $4.50. We also calculated the total cost of all the fruits, which is $13.00, and the change Verna received, which is 700 cents.\n\nTo return the answer in the required format, we can use the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation, unit, and final answer\nexplanation = \"Verna bought fruits for $13.00 and gave $20, so the change she received is\"\nunit = \"cents\"\nfinal_answer = 700\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and final answer\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nThis will give us the answer in the required format.
