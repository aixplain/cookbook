Since the English alphabet consists of 26 letters, we can use this information to calculate the number of letters Elise writes in full twice.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of letters in the alphabet\ntotal_letters = 26\n\n# Calculate the number of letters Elise writes in full twice\nletters_written_twice = total_letters * 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(letters_written_twice)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of letters Elise writes in full twice and print the result.
