To find the number of toys Jonathan currently has, we need to solve the equation 5 * 80 = x + 2 for x.\n\nExplanation: \nThe equation 5 * 80 = x + 2 represents the situation where Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he already has to have a play set five times larger than James's play set. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.\n\nUnit: \nToys\n\nFinal Answer: \nThe value of x is 398.",
