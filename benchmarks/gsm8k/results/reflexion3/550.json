We will use the costs calculated in the previous step.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the costs of each item (calculated in the previous step)\nnotebook_cost = 7.5  # Output from previous step: Notebook cost: $ 7.5\npen_cost = 0.5      # Output from previous step: Pen cost: $ 0.5\ncalculator_cost = 12  # Output from previous step: Calculator cost: $ 12\ngeometry_set_cost = 10  # Output from previous step: Geometry set cost: $ 10\n\n# Calculate the total cost before discount\ntotal_cost_before_discount = notebook_cost + pen_cost + calculator_cost + geometry_set_cost\n\n# Print the total cost before discount\nprint(\"Total cost before discount: $\", total_cost_before_discount)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total cost before discount by adding up the costs of all the items and print the result.
