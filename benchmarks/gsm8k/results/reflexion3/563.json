We need to calculate the age of the younger son.\n\nTo do this, we can simply subtract 4 from the age of the older son. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the age of the older son\nolder_son_age = 12\n\n# Calculate the age of the younger son\nyounger_son_age = older_son_age - 4\n\n# Print the age of the younger son\nprint(\"The age of the younger son is:\", younger_son_age)\n```\n\nThis will give us the age of the younger son. Please provide the output of this code as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The age of the younger son is 8.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where James has two sons, one of whom is 12 years old and the other is 8 years old. We need to calculate the total number of candles needed for both sons.\n\nTo do this, we can simply add the ages of both sons. Since each son needs candles equal to his age, the total number of candles needed will be the sum of their ages.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the age of the older son\nolder_son_age = 12\n\n# Define the age of the younger son\nyounger_son_age = 8\n\n# Calculate the total number of candles needed\ntotal_candles_needed = older_son_age + younger_son_age\n\n# Print the total number of candles needed\nprint(\"The total number of candles needed is:\", total_candles_needed)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of candles needed.

We have already calculated the total number of candles needed, which is 20. Now, we need to calculate the total number of packs needed. Each pack contains 5 candles and costs $3.\n\nTo do this, we can divide the total number of candles needed by the number of candles in each pack. This will give us the total number of packs needed. If there is a remainder, we will need to round up to the nearest whole number, as James cannot buy a fraction of a pack.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of candles needed\ntotal_candles_needed = 20\n\n# Define the number of candles in each pack\ncandles_per_pack = 5\n\n# Calculate the total number of packs needed\ntotal_packs_needed = -(-total_candles_needed // candles_per_pack)\n\n# Print the total number of packs needed\nprint(\"The total number of packs needed is:\", total_packs_needed)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of packs needed.
