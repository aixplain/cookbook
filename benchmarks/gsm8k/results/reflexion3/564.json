There are 7 nights in a week.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pages Judy can read per minute\npages_per_minute = 1.3333333333333333\n\n# Define the number of minutes Judy read each night\nminutes_per_night = 15\n\n# Define the number of nights in a week\nnights_in_a_week = 7\n\n# Calculate the number of pages Judy read in the first week\npages_read_in_first_week = pages_per_minute * minutes_per_night * nights_in_a_week\n\nprint(pages_read_in_first_week)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of pages Judy read in the first week is 140.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we need to add the number of pages she read in the first week and the second week.\n\nUsing the given information, we know that Judy read 140 pages in the first week (from the previous intermediate step) and she read a total of 100 pages in the second week.\n\nHere's a Python code snippet to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pages Judy read in the first week\npages_read_in_first_week = 140\n\n# Define the number of pages Judy read in the second week\npages_read_in_second_week = 100\n\n# Calculate the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks\ntotal_pages_read = pages_read_in_first_week + pages_read_in_second_week\n\nprint(total_pages_read)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of pages Judy read in two weeks is 240.'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nAdd the number of pages Judy read in the first week and the second week\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
