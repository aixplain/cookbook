The explanation and unit are missing in the response. Also, the final answer should be an integer, but the total number of action figures is 23.0 (not an integer) because the number of plastic action figures is 15.0 (not an integer).\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, we need to determine how many wooden action figures he bought during this period.\n\nSince Peter spent an equal amount each day for one week and he spent his money on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, we can assume that he bought the same number of wooden action figures each day during this period.\n\nGiven that the wooden action figures cost $5 each, we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures by multiplying the number of days (4 days from Sunday to Wednesday) by the cost of each action figure ($5) and then dividing by the daily amount spent.\n\nHowever, we do not know the daily amount spent yet. We only know that Peter has $70 and he will spend an equal amount each day for one week. To find the daily amount spent, we can divide the total amount of money ($70) by the number of days in a week (7).\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the daily amount spent and the total amount spent on wooden action figures:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount of money and the number of days in a week\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate the daily amount spent\ndaily_amount_spent = total_money / days_in_week\n\n# Calculate the number of wooden action figures bought each day\nwooden_action_figures_per_day = daily_amount_spent / 5\n\n# Calculate the total number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday\ntotal_wooden_action_figures = wooden_action_figures_per_day * 4\n\n# Print the total amount spent on wooden action figures\nprint(\"Total amount spent on wooden action figures: $\", total_wooden_action_figures * 5)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday is $40.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the remaining amount of money Peter has to spend on plastic action figures, we need to subtract the total amount spent on wooden action figures from the total amount of money he had.\n\nWe already calculated the total amount spent on wooden action figures in the previous step, which is $40.0. We also know that Peter had $70 initially.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the remaining amount of money:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount of money and the total amount spent on wooden action figures\ntotal_money = 70\ntotal_amount_spent_on_wooden_action_figures = 40.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount of money\nremaining_money = total_money - total_amount_spent_on_wooden_action_figures\n\n# Print the remaining amount of money\nprint(\"Remaining amount of money: $\", remaining_money)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The remaining amount of money Peter has to spend on plastic action figures is $30.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money, we need to divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of each plastic action figure.\n\nWe already calculated the remaining amount of money in the previous step, which is $30.0. We also know that the plastic action figures cost $2 each.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the number of plastic action figures:\n\n```python\n# Define the remaining amount of money and the cost of each plastic action figure\nremaining_money = 30.0\ncost_of_plastic_action_figure = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of plastic action figures\nnumber_of_plastic_action_figures = remaining_money / cost_of_plastic_action_figure\n\n# Print the number of plastic action figures\nprint(\"Number of plastic action figures:\", number_of_plastic_action_figures)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, we need to calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. We can do this by adding the total number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday (which we calculated in INTERMEDIATE STEP 1) to the number of plastic action figures.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total number of action figures:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of wooden action figures and the number of plastic action figures\ntotal_wooden_action_figures = 8  # This value was calculated in INTERMEDIATE STEP 1\nnumber_of_plastic_action_figures = remaining_money / cost_of_plastic_action_figure\n\n# Calculate the total number of action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_action_figures + number_of_plastic_action_figures\n\n# Print the total number of action figures\nprint(\"Total number of action figures:\", total_action_figures)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Peter can buy 15 plastic action figures with the remaining money.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. For the rest of the week, he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. How many total action figures will he have by the end of the week?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total amount of money Peter spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, we need to determine how many wooden action figures he bought during this period.\n\nSince Peter spent an equal amount each day for one week and he spent his money on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday, we can assume that he bought the same number of wooden action figures each day during this period.\n\nGiven that the wooden action figures cost $5 each, we can calculate the total amount spent on wooden action figures by multiplying the number of days (4 days from Sunday to Wednesday) by the cost of each action figure ($5) and then dividing by the daily amount spent.\n\nHowever, we do not know the daily amount spent yet. We only know that Peter has $70 and he will spend an equal amount each day for one week. To find the daily amount spent, we can divide the total amount of money ($70) by the number of days in a week (7).\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the daily amount spent and the total amount spent on wooden action figures:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount of money and the number of days in a week\ntotal_money = 70\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate the daily amount spent\ndaily_amount_spent = total_money / days_in_week\n\n# Calculate the number of wooden action figures bought each day\nwooden_action_figures_per_day = daily_amount_spent / 5\n\n# Calculate the total number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday\ntotal_wooden_action_figures = wooden_action_figures_per_day * 4\n\n# Print the total amount spent on wooden action figures\nprint(\"Total amount spent on wooden action figures: $\", total_wooden_action_figures * 5)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount spent on wooden action figures from Sunday through Wednesday is $40.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the remaining amount of money Peter has to spend on plastic action figures, we need to subtract the total amount spent on wooden action figures from the total amount of money he had.\n\nWe already calculated the total amount spent on wooden action figures in the previous step, which is $40.0. We also know that Peter had $70 initially.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the remaining amount of money:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount of money and the total amount spent on wooden action figures\ntotal_money = 70\ntotal_amount_spent_on_wooden_action_figures = 40.0\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount of money\nremaining_money = total_money - total_amount_spent_on_wooden_action_figures\n\n# Print the remaining amount of money\nprint(\"Remaining amount of money: $\", remaining_money)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The remaining amount of money Peter has to spend on plastic action figures is $30.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of plastic action figures Peter can buy with the remaining money, we need to divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of each plastic action figure.\n\nWe already calculated the remaining amount of money in the previous step, which is $30.0. We also know that the plastic action figures cost $2 each.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the number of plastic action figures:\n\n```python\n# Define the remaining amount of money and the cost of each plastic action figure\nremaining_money = 30.0\ncost_of_plastic_action_figure = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of plastic action figures\nnumber_of_plastic_action_figures = remaining_money / cost_of_plastic_action_figure\n\n# Print the number of plastic action figures\nprint(\"Number of plastic action figures:\", number_of_plastic_action_figures)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, we need to calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week. We can do this by adding the total number of wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday (which we calculated in INTERMEDIATE STEP 1) to the number of plastic action figures.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total number of action figures:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of wooden action figures and the number of plastic action figures\ntotal_wooden_action_figures = 8  # This value was calculated in INTERMEDIATE STEP 1\nnumber_of_plastic_action_figures = remaining_money / cost_of_plastic_action_figure\n\n# Calculate the total number of action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_action_figures + number_of_plastic_action_figures\n\n# Print the total number of action figures\nprint(\"Total number of action figures:\", total_action_figures)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Peter can buy 15 plastic action figures with the remaining money. The total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week is 23.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo provide the final answer in the required format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer], we need to calculate the total number of action figures Peter will have by the end of the week and ensure that the final answer is an integer.\n\nWe already calculated the total number of action figures in INTERMEDIATE STEP 3, which is 23. However, this value is not an integer because the number of plastic action figures is 15.0 (not an integer).\n\nTo fix this issue, we can round down the number of plastic action figures to the nearest integer, since Peter cannot buy a fraction of an action figure.\n\nHere is the Python code to calculate the total number of action figures and ensure that the final answer is an integer:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of wooden action figures and the number of plastic action figures\ntotal_wooden_action_figures = 8  # This value was calculated in INTERMEDIATE STEP 1\nnumber_of_plastic_action_figures = 15.0  # This value was calculated in INTERMEDIATE STEP 3\n\n# Round down the number of plastic action figures to the nearest integer\nimport math\nnumber_of_plastic_action_figures = math.floor(number_of_plastic_action_figures)\n\n# Calculate the total number of action figures\ntotal_action_figures = total_wooden_action_figures + number_of_plastic_action_figures\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and final answer\nprint(\"Peter has a total of\", total_action_figures, \"action figures by the end of the week.\")\nprint(\"Unit: action figures\")\nprint(\"Final answer:\", total_action_figures)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Peter has a total of 23 action figures by the end of the week.
