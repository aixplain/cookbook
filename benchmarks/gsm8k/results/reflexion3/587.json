Since the jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of green jelly beans is 1.01 times the number of blue jelly beans. Similarly, since the jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99 times the number of blue jelly beans.\n\nWe have already calculated the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans in the previous steps. The number of green jelly beans is 1515 and the number of red jelly beans is 1485.\n\nTo calculate the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans, we can subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans.\n\nTo calculate this in python, we can use the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of green jelly beans\ngreen_jelly_beans = 1515\n\n# Define the number of red jelly beans\nred_jelly_beans = 1485\n\n# Calculate the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans\ndifference = green_jelly_beans - red_jelly_beans\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans is:\", difference)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the final answer.\n\nAlso, we need to provide the answer in the required format: [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. The explanation is: \"The jar contains X more green jelly beans than red jelly beans\". The unit is \"jelly beans\". The final answer is the difference between the number of green jelly beans and the number of red jelly beans.\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"The jar contains {} more green jelly beans than red jelly beans\".format(difference)\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"jelly beans\"\n\n# Define the final answer\nfinal_answer = difference\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The final answer is:\", [explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the final answer.",
