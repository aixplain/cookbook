In the previous steps, we calculated the number of sheep in Charleston, which is 80, the number of sheep in Toulouse, which is 160, and the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, which is 260.\n\nUsing the information provided, we can return the answer in the required format: [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. The explanation is that Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. The unit is sheep. The final answer is the total number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, and Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.\"\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"sheep\"\n\n# Define the final answer\nfinal_answer = 260\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nThis will give us the answer in the required format.",
