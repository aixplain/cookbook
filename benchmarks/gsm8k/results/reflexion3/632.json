We know that Max bought 19 truck stamps.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\ntruck_stamps = 19\nrose_stamps = truck_stamps - 9\nprint(rose_stamps)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of rose stamps Max bought.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Max bought 10 rose stamps.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps. We know that Max bought 16 snowflake stamps, 19 truck stamps, and 10 rose stamps.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\nsnowflake_stamps = 16\ntruck_stamps = 19\nrose_stamps = 10\ntotal_stamps = snowflake_stamps + truck_stamps + rose_stamps\nprint(\"Max bought\", total_stamps, \"stamps in all.\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of stamps Max bought. Please format the answer as [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'[The total number of stamps Max bought is calculated by adding the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps, stamps, 45]'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of stamps Max bought, we need to add the number of snowflake stamps, truck stamps, and rose stamps.
