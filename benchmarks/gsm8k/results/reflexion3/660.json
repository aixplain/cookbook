We need to find out how many sheep live on Lee's farm.\n\nLet's denote the number of sheep as S and the number of geese as G. We know that sheep have 4 legs and geese have 2 legs. We also know that each animal has one head.\n\nWe can define the variables and the system of linear equations as follows:\n\nLet S be the number of sheep and G be the number of geese.\n\nThe total number of animal legs is 70, so we can write the equation: 4S + 2G = 70\n\nThe total number of animal heads is 20, so we can write the equation: S + G = 20\n\nWe need to solve this system of linear equations to find the value of S (the number of sheep).\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to solve the system of linear equations.\n\nUse the following code to solve the system of linear equations:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the coefficients matrix\nA = np.array([[4, 2], [1, 1]])\n\n# Define the constants matrix\nB = np.array([70, 20])\n\n# Solve the system of linear equations\nsolution = np.linalg.solve(A, B)\n\n# Print the solution\nprint(\"20 animals have a total of 70 legs, 15 of them are sheep, sheep, \", int(solution[0]))\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, please note that the output should be in the format of [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. For example, 3 apples minus 1 are 2 apples, apples, 2.",
