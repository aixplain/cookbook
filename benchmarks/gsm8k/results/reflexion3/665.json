0.4.\n\nHere's the Python code to do this:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of teachers\ntotal_teachers = 150\n\n# Calculate the number of history teachers (already calculated in the previous step)\nhistory_teachers = 90.0\n\n# Calculate the number of math teachers\nmath_teachers = total_teachers - history_teachers\n\n# Print the result\nprint(math_teachers)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of math teachers is 60.0'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP
