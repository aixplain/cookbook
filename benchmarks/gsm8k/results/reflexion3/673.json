If Janey has 21 books, we need to find out how many books Sally has.\n\nIn the previous steps, we defined the equation based on the given information and solved for 'S'. The equation is 2S + 3 = 21, where 'S' denotes the number of books Sally has.\n\nWe have already solved the equation for 'S' and found that Sally has 9 books.\n\nNow, we need to format the answer as per the user's request. The answer should be in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].\n\nHowever, the explanation should be in the format \"Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, Sally has 9 books, books, 9\". \n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to format the answer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation, unit, and final answer\nexplanation = \"Janey has 3 more than twice the number of books that Sally has. If Janey has 21 books, Sally has\"\nunit = \"books\"\nfinal_answer = 9\n\n# Print the answer in the required format\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output.",
