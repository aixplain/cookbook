In the previous step, we calculated the total parts in the ratio, which is 5. Now, we need to calculate the amount of money Gerald received.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code to calculate Gerald's share of the money:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount of money\ntotal_money = 100\n\n# Define the total parts in the ratio\ntotal_parts = 5\n\n# Define Gerald's parts in the ratio\ngerald_parts = 3\n\n# Calculate Gerald's share of the money\ngerald_share = (gerald_parts / total_parts) * total_money\n\nprint(gerald_share)\n```\n\nThis will give us the amount of money Gerald received, which we can use in the next step to calculate how much money he had left after spending $10 on a book.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Gerald received $60.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where Gerald and Julia divided $100 in the ratio 3:2. In the previous steps, we calculated the total parts in the ratio, which is 5, and Gerald's share of the money, which is $60.0. Now, we need to calculate how much money Gerald had left after spending $10 on a book.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code to calculate the amount of money Gerald had left:\n\n```python\n# Define the amount of money Gerald received\ngerald_share = 60.0\n\n# Define the amount Gerald spent on a book\ngerald_spent = 10\n\n# Calculate the amount of money Gerald had left\ngerald_left = gerald_share - gerald_spent\n\nprint(gerald_left)\n```\n\nThis will give us the amount of money Gerald had left after spending $10 on a book.
