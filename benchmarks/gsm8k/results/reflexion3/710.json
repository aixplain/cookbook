Finally, you can subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final bill.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total cost of the croissants, the total cost of the cinnamon rolls, the total cost of the mini quiches, and the total cost of the blueberry muffins\ntotal_cost_croissants = 15.00\ntotal_cost_cinnamon_rolls = 10.00\ntotal_cost_mini_quiches = 12.00\ntotal_cost_blueberry_muffins = 13.00\n\n# Calculate the total cost of all the items\ntotal_cost = total_cost_croissants + total_cost_cinnamon_rolls + total_cost_mini_quiches + total_cost_blueberry_muffins\n\n# Calculate the discount\ndiscount = total_cost * 0.10\n\n# Calculate the final bill\nfinal_bill = total_cost - discount\n\n# Print the final bill\nprint(\"The final bill is: \", final_bill)\n```\n\nThis will give you the final bill.

Finally, you can subtract the discount from the total cost to get the final bill.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total cost of the croissants, the total cost of the cinnamon rolls, the total cost of the mini quiches, and the total cost of the blueberry muffins\ntotal_cost_croissants = 15.00\ntotal_cost_cinnamon_rolls = 10.00\ntotal_cost_mini_quiches = 12.00\ntotal_cost_blueberry_muffins = 13.00\n\n# Calculate the total cost of all the items\ntotal_cost = total_cost_croissants + total_cost_cinnamon_rolls + total_cost_mini_quiches + total_cost_blueberry_muffins\n\n# Calculate the discount\ndiscount = total_cost * 0.10\n\n# Calculate the final bill\nfinal_bill = total_cost - discount\n\n# Print the final bill\nprint(\"The final bill is: \", final_bill)\n\n# Print the final answer in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\nprint(\"Marcus ordered 5 croissants at $3.00 apiece, 4 cinnamon rolls at $2.50 each, 3 mini quiches for $4.00 apiece and 13 blueberry muffins that were $1.00 apiece.
