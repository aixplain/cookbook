Please provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The new price of each computer after the 10% increase is $770. The total amount of money the company paid to buy 500 computers at the new price is $385,000.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the total amount of money a company paid to buy computers at new prices.
