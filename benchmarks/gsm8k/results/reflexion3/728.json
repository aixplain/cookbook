This will be used to provide the final answer.\n\nAlso, please format the final answer as follows: [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. For example: \"Candy has 40% blue spools, percent, 40\"'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Candy has 40% blue spools, percent, 40'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
