We need to calculate the total amount of money saved per day by multiplying the difference in cost per tomato by the number of tomatoes sold per day.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated the difference in cost per tomato between the old and new vendors, which is 0.1. Now, we can use this result to calculate the total amount of money saved per day.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of tomatoes sold per day\ntomatoes_sold_per_day = 500\n\n# Define the difference in cost per tomato (result from previous step)\ncost_difference = 0.1\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money saved per day\nmoney_saved_per_day = tomatoes_sold_per_day * cost_difference\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The total amount of money saved per day is: \", money_saved_per_day)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount of money saved per day. We will use this result in the next step to calculate the total amount of money saved per week.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount of money saved per day is $50.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where a tomato vendor switches to a new vendor who sells tomatoes at a lower price. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day and used to buy them for $0.5 each, but the new vendor sells them for $0.4 each. We need to calculate the total amount of money saved per week by multiplying the amount of money saved per day by the number of days in a week.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the difference in cost per tomato between the old and new vendors, which is 0.1, and the total amount of money saved per day, which is $50.0. Now, we can use this result to calculate the total amount of money saved per week.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of days in a week\ndays_in_a_week = 7\n\n# Define the total amount of money saved per day (result from previous step)\nmoney_saved_per_day = 50.0\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money saved per week\nmoney_saved_per_week = money_saved_per_day * days_in_a_week\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The total amount of money saved per week is: \", money_saved_per_week)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total amount of money saved per week. We will use this result to provide the final answer in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The tomato vendor saves $350 per week by switching to the new vendor, dollars, 350'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
