We can do this by multiplying the total number of chairs rented out in a month by 2.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_a_month = total_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month + total_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month\nmonths = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_two_months = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month * months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_chairs_rented_in_two_months)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the final answer.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nweekdays_in_a_week = 5\nweeks_in_a_month = 4\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekdays = 60\nweekend_days_in_a_week = 2\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends = 100\nmonths = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of weekdays in a month\ntotal_weekdays_in_a_month = weekdays_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekdays in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month = total_weekdays_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekdays\n\n# Calculate total number of weekend days in a month\ntotal_weekend_days_in_a_month = weekend_days_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekends in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month = total_weekend_days_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_a_month = total_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month + total_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_two_months = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month * months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Explanation: Total chairs rented out in two 4-week months is the sum of chairs rented out on weekdays and weekends in a month multiplied by 2.\")\nprint(\"Unit: chairs\")\nprint(\"Final answer:\", total_chairs_rented_in_two_months)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Explanation: Total chairs rented out in two 4-week months is the sum of chairs rented out on weekdays and weekends in a month multiplied by 2.

To calculate the total number of chairs rented out on weekends in a month, we can multiply the number of weekend days by the number of chairs rented out per day.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nweekend_days_in_a_week = 2\nweeks_in_a_month = 4\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends = 100\n\n# Calculate total number of weekend days in a month\ntotal_weekend_days_in_a_month = weekend_days_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekends in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month = total_weekend_days_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months. We can do this by multiplying the total number of chairs rented out in a month by 2.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_a_month = total_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month + total_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month\nmonths = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_two_months = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month * months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(total_chairs_rented_in_two_months)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the final answer.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nweekdays_in_a_week = 5\nweeks_in_a_month = 4\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekdays = 60\nweekend_days_in_a_week = 2\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends = 100\nmonths = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of weekdays in a month\ntotal_weekdays_in_a_month = weekdays_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekdays in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month = total_weekdays_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekdays\n\n# Calculate total number of weekend days in a month\ntotal_weekend_days_in_a_month = weekend_days_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekends in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month = total_weekend_days_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_a_month = total_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month + total_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_two_months = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month * months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Explanation: Total chairs rented out in two 4-week months is the sum of chairs rented out on weekdays and weekends in a month multiplied by 2.\")\nprint(\"Unit: chairs\")\nprint(\"Final answer:\", total_chairs_rented_in_two_months)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Explanation: Total chairs rented out in two 4-week months is the sum of chairs rented out on weekdays and weekends in a month multiplied by 2.

We can do this by multiplying the total number of chairs rented out in a month by 2.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_a_month = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month  # Output from previous step\nmonths = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_two_months = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month * months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Total chairs rented out in two 4-week months:\", total_chairs_rented_in_two_months)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the final answer.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nweekdays_in_a_week = 5\nweekend_days_in_a_week = 2\nweeks_in_a_month = 4\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekdays = 60\nchairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends = 100\nmonths = 2\n\n# Calculate total number of weekdays in a month\ntotal_weekdays_in_a_month = weekdays_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of weekend days in a month\ntotal_weekend_days_in_a_month = weekend_days_in_a_week * weeks_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekdays in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month = total_weekdays_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekdays\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out on weekends in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month = total_weekend_days_in_a_month * chairs_rented_per_day_on_weekends\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in a month\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_a_month = total_chairs_rented_on_weekdays_in_a_month + total_chairs_rented_on_weekends_in_a_month\n\n# Calculate total number of chairs rented out in two 4-week months\ntotal_chairs_rented_in_two_months = total_chairs_rented_in_a_month * months\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"Explanation: Total chairs rented out in two 4-week months is the sum of chairs rented out on weekdays and weekends in a month multiplied by 2.\")\nprint(\"Unit: chairs\")\nprint(\"Final answer:\", total_chairs_rented_in_two_months)\n```",
