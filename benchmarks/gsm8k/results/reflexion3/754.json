    "question": "Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.

        "input": "Return the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer],Example: 3 apples minus 1 are 2 apples, apples, 2Lorraine and Colleen are trading stickers for buttons. Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. A small sticker is worth one small button. A large button is worth three small stickers. Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?",
        "output": "Explanation: \nLorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which is 27 small stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which is 20 large stickers, and the rest for small buttons, which is also 20 large stickers. \nSince each small sticker is worth one small button and each large sticker is worth three small buttons, the 20 large stickers traded for small buttons will be worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. \nSince each large sticker is worth one large button, the 20 large stickers traded for large buttons will be worth 20 large buttons. \nSince each small sticker is worth one small button and each large button is worth three small stickers, the 27 small stickers traded for large buttons will be worth 27 large buttons. \nSo, in total, Lorraine will have 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons and 60 small buttons. \nSince each large button is worth three small buttons, the 47 large buttons will be worth 47 * 3 = 141 small buttons. \nSo, in total, Lorraine will have 141 + 60 = 201 small buttons. \nSince the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the number of large buttons and the number of small buttons. \nHowever, since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons and add them to the total number of small buttons. \nSo, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 201 small buttons.\n\nUnit: buttons\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 201.",

She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons. How many buttons does she have by the end?",
                "output": "Explanation: \nLorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers. She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons, which is 27 small stickers. She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons, which is 20 large stickers, and the rest for small buttons, which is also 20 large stickers. \nSince each small sticker is worth one small button and each large sticker is worth three small buttons, the 20 large stickers traded for small buttons will be worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. \nSince each large sticker is worth one large button, the 20 large stickers traded for large buttons will be worth 20 large buttons. \nSince each small sticker is worth one small button and each large button is worth three small stickers, the 27 small stickers traded for large buttons will be worth 27 large buttons. \nSo, in total, Lorraine will have 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons and 60 small buttons. \nSince each large button is worth three small buttons, the 47 large buttons will be worth 47 * 3 = 141 small buttons. \nSo, in total, Lorraine will have 141 + 60 = 201 small buttons. \nSince the problem asks for the total number of buttons, we need to add the number of large buttons and the number of small buttons. \nHowever, since each large button is worth three small buttons, we can convert the large buttons to small buttons and add them to the total number of small buttons. \nSo, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is 201 small buttons.\n\nUnit: buttons\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 201.",
