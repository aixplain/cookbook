The problem states that Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday.\n\nTo start solving this problem, we need to calculate the number of matches Joey played on Monday. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nmonday_matches = 2\nprint(\"The number of matches Joey played on Monday is:\", monday_matches)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of matches Joey played on Monday. We will use this value in the next step to calculate the total number of matches Joey played in one week.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of matches Joey played on Monday is 2.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem to calculate the number of matches Joey played in one week. The problem states that Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated the number of matches Joey played on Monday, which is 2.\n\nTo continue solving this problem, we need to calculate the number of matches Joey played on Friday. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nfriday_matches = 1\nprint(\"The number of matches Joey played on Friday is:\", friday_matches)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of matches Joey played on Friday. We will use this value in the next step to calculate the total number of matches Joey played in one week.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of matches Joey played on Friday is 1.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem to calculate the number of matches Joey played in one week. The problem states that Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday, and on Saturday he played double the number of matches he played on Monday.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the number of matches Joey played on Monday, which is 2, and the number of matches Joey played on Friday, which is 1.\n\nTo continue solving this problem, we need to calculate the number of matches Joey played on Saturday. According to the problem, Joey played double the number of matches he played on Monday. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following python command:\n\n```python\nmonday_matches = 2\nsaturday_matches = monday_matches * 2\nprint(\"The number of matches Joey played on Saturday is:\", saturday_matches)\n```\n\nThis will give us the number of matches Joey played on Saturday.
