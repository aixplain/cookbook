If there are 33 people on the council, what was the number of votes in favor of the new regulation?\nFEEDBACK: The final answer should be the number of votes in favor of the new regulation, which is twice the number of votes against it. The correct solution for x is 11, and the number of votes in favor is 2 * 11 = 22. However, the problem states that the number of votes against the new regulation is x, and the total number of votes is 33. This means that the number of votes against the new regulation is 11, and the number of votes in favor is 22. But the total number of votes is 33, so the number of votes in favor should be 33 - 11 = 22. Since the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against it, the correct answer is indeed 22. However, the explanation provided by the worker is correct but the unit should be \"votes in favor\" instead of \"votes\" and the final answer is correct but the explanation does not mention that the total number of votes is 33.\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given the equation x + 2x = 33, where x represents the number of votes against the new regulation.
