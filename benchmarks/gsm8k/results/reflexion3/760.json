We will use this information to calculate the total number of people.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of people who think horse #2 will win\npeople_horse_2 = 110\n\n# Calculate the total number of people\ntotal_people = people_horse_2 / 2.2\n\n# Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win\npeople_horse_2 = (220/100) * total_people\n\n# Calculate the number of remaining people\nremaining_people = total_people - people_horse_2\n\n# Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win\npeople_horse_7 = (60/100) * remaining_people\n\n# Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win\npeople_horse_12 = remaining_people - people_horse_7\n\n# Explanation\nexplanation = f\"{int(people_horse_12)} people think horse #12 will win the big race.\"\n\n# Unit\nunit = \"people\"\n\n# Final answer\nfinal_answer = int(people_horse_12)\n\n# Print the result\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nNote: The code has been modified to avoid infinite loops and time limits. The total number of people is calculated based on the number of people who think horse #2 will win, and then the number of people who think horse #7 will win is calculated based on the remaining people.

The issue arises from the lines where you calculate 'people_horse_2' and 'total_people'. The value of 'total_people' is being recalculated based on 'people_horse_2', which in turn is calculated based on 'total_people'.

How many people think that horse #12 will win?\nFEEDBACK: The provided code seems to have an infinite loop or is taking too long to execute, resulting in the \"Agent stopped due to iteration limit or time limit\" error. However, upon reviewing the code, it appears that there is no infinite loop. The issue might be due to the division operation in the line `total_people = people_horse_2 / (220/100)`. This line can be simplified to `total_people = people_horse_2 / 2.2` to avoid potential precision issues. Additionally, the line `people_horse_2 = (220/100) * total_people` is unnecessary and can be removed. Here is the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of people who think horse #2 will win\npeople_horse_2 = 110\n\n# Calculate the total number of people\ntotal_people = people_horse_2 / 2.2\n\n# Calculate the number of remaining people\nremaining_people = total_people - people_horse_2\n\n# Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win\npeople_horse_7 = (60/100) * remaining_people\n\n# Calculate the number of people who think horse #12 will win\npeople_horse_12 = remaining_people - people_horse_7\n\n# Explanation\nexplanation = f\"{int(people_horse_12)} people think horse #12 will win the big race.\"\n\n# Unit\nunit = \"people\"\n\n# Final answer\nfinal_answer = int(people_horse_12)\n\n# Print the result\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease re-execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win, we need to first determine the total number of people and then find 220% of that number.\n\nSince we don't have the total number of people, let's assume it as a variable 'total_people'.
