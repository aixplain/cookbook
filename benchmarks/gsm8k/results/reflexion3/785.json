We need to calculate the total amount of money she paid for the lunch. \n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of money Carrie had from the twenties. Since there are 10 twenties, and each twenty is worth $20, we can calculate the total amount of money from the twenties by multiplying the number of twenties by the value of each twenty.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of twenties and the value of each twenty\nnum_twenties = 10\nvalue_per_twenty = 20\n\n# Calculate the total amount of money from the twenties\ntotal_from_twenties = num_twenties * value_per_twenty\n\n# Print the total amount of money from the twenties\nprint(total_from_twenties)\n```\n\nPlease execute this command and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total amount of money Carrie had from the twenties is 200 and the total amount of money from the quarters is 35.0.
