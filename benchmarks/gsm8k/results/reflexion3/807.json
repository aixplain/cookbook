We know that it takes 12 chips to make one square inch and that Milo wants his mosaic to be 3 inches tall. We can calculate the total number of chips he has by multiplying the number of bags by the number of chips per bag. Then, we can divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch to find the total number of square inches he can cover. Finally, we can divide the total number of square inches by the height of the mosaic to find the length.",
