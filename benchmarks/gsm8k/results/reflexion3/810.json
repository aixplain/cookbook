Now, we need to calculate the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the number of students at the beginning of the year.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can simply subtract the initial number of students (10) from the total number of students at the end of May (320). However, we have already done this in the previous step. So, we can just use the result from the previous step.\n\nHere's how you can do it using python_repl:\n\n```python\n# Initialize the number of students at the beginning of the year\ninitial_students = 10\n\n# Initialize the number of students at the end of May\nstudents_at_end_of_may = 320\n\n# Calculate the difference between the number of students at the end of May and the number of students at the beginning of the year\ndifference = students_at_end_of_may - initial_students\n\n# Print the explanation, unit, and final answer\nprint(\"The number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month. If there are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year, the number of students at the end of May is\", students_at_end_of_may, \"students.\")\nprint(\"students\")\nprint(difference)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using python_repl and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The difference between the number of students at the end of May and the number of students at the beginning of the year is 310 students.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where the number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month.
