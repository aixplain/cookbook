On average, how many branches did he climb per day?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'To calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week, we need to divide the total amount of money he made ($105) by the cost per branch ($0.25). \n\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT: Calculate the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week by executing the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total amount of money Felix made\ntotal_money = 105\n\n# Define the cost per branch\ncost_per_branch = 0.25\n\n# Calculate the total number of branches\ntotal_branches = total_money / cost_per_branch\n\n# Print the total number of branches\nprint(total_branches)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of branches Felix climbed during the week is 420.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'WORKER: Python Code Executor\n\nASSIGNMENT: Calculate the average number of branches Felix climbed per day by executing the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of branches Felix climbed during the week\ntotal_branches = 420\n\n# Define the number of days in a week\ndays_in_week = 7\n\n# Calculate the average number of branches per day\naverage_branches_per_day = total_branches / days_in_week\n\n# Print the explanation\nprint(\"Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.
