    "question": "Rose is out picking flowers for a vase she wants to fill.  She starts off by picking 3 flowers with 5 petals each.  She then picks 4 flowers with 6 petals each.  She then adds another 5 flowers with 4 petals each.  Lastly she picks 6 flowers with 7 petals each.  As she's carrying these flowers over to fill the vase, she drops 1 of each and the wind blows them away.  She puts the remaining flowers in the vase.
