There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes. Now, we can calculate the total time each person plays in minutes. Jack plays for 240 minutes, his two worse friends play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each (but they can only play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter, so they will play 120 / 10 = 12 quarters each), and his better friend plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes (but he can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter, so he will play 360 / 30 = 12 quarters).

One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long.  They play for 4 hours.

Two of his friends are significantly worse than him and can only play half as long, which is 20 / 2 = 10 minutes. One of them is significantly better and can play for 1.5 times as long, which is 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes.\n\nSince they play for 4 hours, we need to convert this time to minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is equal to 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.\n\nNow, we can calculate the total time each person plays in minutes. Jack plays for 240 minutes, his two worse friends play for 240 / 2 = 120 minutes each (but they can only play for 10 minutes with 1 quarter, so they will play 120 / 10 = 12 quarters each), and his better friend plays for 240 * 1.5 = 360 minutes (but he can play for 30 minutes with 1 quarter, so he will play 360 / 30 = 12 quarters).\n\nHowever, we are interested in the total time each person plays in minutes with the quarters they have.
