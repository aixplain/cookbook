How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of blue eggs, we need to recall that Cindy had twice as many blue eggs as green eggs. We know she had 5 green eggs. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the number of blue eggs as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of green eggs\ngreen_eggs = 5\n\n# Calculate the number of blue eggs\nblue_eggs = 2 * green_eggs\n\n# Print the number of blue eggs\nprint(blue_eggs)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the number of blue eggs.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of blue eggs is 10.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of pink eggs, we need to recall that Cindy had one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs. We know she had 10 blue eggs.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the number of pink eggs as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of blue eggs\nblue_eggs = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of pink eggs\npink_eggs = blue_eggs - 1\n\n# Print the number of pink eggs\nprint(pink_eggs)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the number of pink eggs.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of pink eggs is 9.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of yellow eggs, we need to recall that Cindy had one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. We know she had 9 pink eggs.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can calculate the number of yellow eggs as follows:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of pink eggs\npink_eggs = 9\n\n# Calculate the number of yellow eggs\nyellow_eggs = pink_eggs // 3\n\n# Print the number of yellow eggs\nprint(yellow_eggs)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the number of yellow eggs.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The number of yellow eggs is 3.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of eggs Cindy had, we need to recall the number of green, blue, pink, and yellow eggs she had.
