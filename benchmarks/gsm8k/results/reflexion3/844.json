Jack collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. If jack collected 60 dishes, calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together?",
        "output": "To calculate the total number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have together, we need to add up the number of socks and dishes each of them has. \n\nFirst, we know that Jack collected 60 dishes, and he collected twice as many dishes as socks in the store. So, we can set up a proportion to find the number of socks. Let's denote the number of socks as `socks`. We know that the number of dishes is twice the number of socks, so we can write the equation: `dishes = 2 * socks`. We are given that Jack collected 60 dishes, so we can substitute this value into the equation: `60 = 2 * socks`. To solve for `socks`, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2: `socks = 60 / 2`. \n\nUsing this equation, we find that Jack has 30 socks. \n\nSince Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, we can calculate the number of socks Peter has by multiplying the number of socks Jack has by 2. So, Peter has 60 socks. \n\nWe also know that Peter has half times as many dishes as Jack. So, we can calculate the number of dishes Peter has by dividing the number of dishes Jack has by 2. Therefore, Peter has 30 dishes. \n\nNow, let's calculate the total number of socks and dishes they have together. We can add up the number of socks and dishes Jack and Peter have. The total number of socks is 30 + 60 = 90. The total number of dishes is 60 + 30 = 90. \n\nTherefore, the total number of socks and dishes they have together is 90 + 90 = 180.\n\nExplanation: Together they have 90 socks and 90 dishes, \nUnit: socks and dishes, \nFinal answer: 180",
