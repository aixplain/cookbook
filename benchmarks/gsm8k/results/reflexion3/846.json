Each group takes 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and then 2 minutes to exit the stage.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, write a Python code to calculate the total time taken by each group in minutes.\n\nHere's a starting point for your code:\n\n```python\n# Define the time taken by each group to get on stage in minutes\nget_on_stage_time_minutes = 2\n\n# Define the time taken by each group to perform in minutes\nperformance_time_minutes = 6\n\n# Define the time taken by each group to exit the stage in minutes\nexit_stage_time_minutes = 2\n\n# Calculate the total time taken by each group in minutes\ntotal_time_per_group_minutes = get_on_stage_time_minutes + performance_time_minutes + exit_stage_time_minutes\n\n# Print the total time taken by each group in minutes\nprint(total_time_per_group_minutes)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the total time taken by each group in minutes.\n\nAlso, recall that the total time available for performances in minutes is 110. We will use this information in the next step to calculate the number of groups that can perform in the concert.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total time taken by each group in minutes is 10.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a task to calculate the number of groups that can perform in Vicki's pop concert.

The explanation should be in the format \"There are enough time slots for X groups to perform in the concert, where each group takes 10 minutes to perform, groups, X\". The unit should be \"groups\". The final answer should be the number of groups that can perform in the concert as an integer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'There are enough time slots for 11 groups to perform in the concert, where each group takes 10 minutes to perform, groups, 11'\n--------------------\n\nWORKER:\nPython Code Executor\n\nNEXT STEP:\nReturn the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]\n\nASSIGNMENT:",
