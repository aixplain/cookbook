In the previous steps, we calculated that the number of rooms to be cleaned is 45.0, the total time required to clean these rooms is 900.0 minutes, and the total time required to clean the rooms in hours is 15.0.\n\nTo provide the final answer, we need to return the answer as an [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. The explanation should be in the format \"It takes housekeeping X hours to clean one-half of the rooms.\", the unit should be \"hours\", and the final answer should be an integer.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"It takes housekeeping 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms.\"\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"hours\"\n\n# Define the final answer as an integer\nfinal_answer = int(15.0)\n\n# Print the result\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nThis will give us the final answer in the required format.",
