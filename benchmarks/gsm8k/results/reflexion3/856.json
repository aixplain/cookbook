He wants to give each student 2 glue sticks. The glue sticks come in packs of 8. How many packs will Mr. Jackson need to buy so every student can have 2 glue sticks, assuming he can only buy whole packs and he expects to have some extra glue sticks left over?\nFEEDBACK: The response should be in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. The explanation should be a string, the unit should be a string, and the final answer should be an integer. The response should be a list containing these three elements.\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total number of glue sticks required, we need to multiply the number of students by the number of glue sticks each student will receive.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of students and glue sticks per student\nstudents = 27\nglue_sticks_per_student = 2\n\n# Calculate the total number of glue sticks required\ntotal_glue_sticks = students * glue_sticks_per_student\n\n# Print the total number of glue sticks required\nprint(total_glue_sticks)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of glue sticks required.
