We need to calculate the total number of oranges given to the son.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated the total number of oranges given to the daughters, which is 6. Now, we need to calculate the total number of oranges given to the son.\n\nTo do this, we can simply use the number of oranges given to the son, which is 3.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of oranges given to the son\noranges_given_to_son = 3\n\n# Print the result\nprint(oranges_given_to_son)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total number of oranges given to the son.
