To calculate the speed of a whirligig, we need to multiply the speed of a thingamabob by 5.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the speed of a thingamabob\nthingamabob_speed = 11.0\n\n# Calculate the speed of a whirligig\nwhirligig_speed = thingamabob_speed * 5\n\n# Print the speed of a whirligig\nprint(whirligig_speed)\n```\n\nThis will give us the speed of a whirligig. Please provide the output as the final answer. \n\nAlso, please provide the explanation as \"A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins eleven times faster than a thingamabob. A whatchamacallit spins at 121 meters per second. To calculate the speed of a whirligig, we first calculated the speed of a thingamabob by dividing the speed of a whatchamacallit by 11, then we multiplied the speed of a thingamabob by 5.\" and the unit as \"meters per second\".'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'A whirligig spins at five times the speed of a thingamabob.
