We need to calculate the weight of Harry in kg.\n\nIn the previous steps, we calculated Carl's weight by adding 16 kg to Martin's weight, and then Christian's weight by adding 8 kg to Carl's weight. The results were Carl's weight is 71 kg and Christian's weight is 79 kg.\n\nThen, we calculated Harry's weight by subtracting 5 kg from Christian's weight. The result was Harry's weight is 74 kg.\n\nNow, we need to return the explanation, unit, and final answer as an integer.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following code:\n\n```python\nexplanation = \"Martin's weight is 55 kg. Carl's weight is 16 kg more than Martin's weight. Christian's weight is 8 kg more than Carl's weight. Harry is 5 kg less than Christian's weight.
