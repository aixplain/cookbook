We will then use this value to calculate Adam's age in 8 years.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Adam's age four years ago is 26.0'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate Adam's current age, we need to add 4 years to his age four years ago. We already know that Adam's age four years ago is 26.0.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define Adam's age four years ago\nadams_age_four_years_ago = 26.0\n\n# Calculate Adam's current age by adding 4 years to his age four years ago\nadams_age_now = adams_age_four_years_ago + 4\n\n# Print Adam's current age\nprint(adams_age_now)\n```\n\nThis will give us Adam's current age. We will then use this value to calculate Adam's age in 8 years.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Adam's current age is 30.0.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate Adam's age in 8 years, we need to add 8 years to his current age.
