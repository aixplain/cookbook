The problem states that Bruce works for 5 hours on Tuesday. We need to calculate the hours worked on Tuesday.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can assign the hours worked on Tuesday to a variable. Please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the hours worked on Tuesday\nhours_worked_on_tuesday = 5\nprint(hours_worked_on_tuesday)\n```\n\nThis will output the hours worked on Tuesday, which we will use in the next step to calculate the hours worked on Wednesday.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The hours worked on Tuesday is 5.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem to calculate the total hours worked by Bruce over three days. In the previous step, we calculated the hours worked on Tuesday, which is 5 hours. The problem states that on Wednesday, Bruce works twice the time he works on Tuesday. We need to calculate the hours worked on Wednesday.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can assign the hours worked on Tuesday to a variable and calculate the hours worked on Wednesday. Please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the hours worked on Tuesday\nhours_worked_on_tuesday = 5\n\n# Calculate the hours worked on Wednesday\nhours_worked_on_wednesday = hours_worked_on_tuesday * 2\nprint(hours_worked_on_wednesday)\n```\n\nThis will output the hours worked on Wednesday, which we will use in the next step to calculate the hours worked on Thursday.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The hours worked on Wednesday is 10 hours.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem to calculate the total hours worked by Bruce over three days. In the previous steps, we calculated the hours worked on Tuesday, which is 5 hours, and the hours worked on Wednesday, which is 10 hours. The problem states that on Thursday, Bruce works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. We need to calculate the hours worked on Thursday.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, we can assign the hours worked on Wednesday to a variable and calculate the hours worked on Thursday. Please execute the following Python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the hours worked on Tuesday\nhours_worked_on_tuesday = 5\n\n# Calculate the hours worked on Wednesday\nhours_worked_on_wednesday = hours_worked_on_tuesday * 2\n\n# Calculate the hours worked on Thursday\nhours_worked_on_thursday = hours_worked_on_wednesday - 2\nprint(hours_worked_on_thursday)\n```\n\nThis will output the hours worked on Thursday, which we will use in the next step to calculate the total hours worked by Bruce over the three days.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The hours worked on Thursday is 8 hours.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 4:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem to calculate the total hours worked by Bruce over three days.
