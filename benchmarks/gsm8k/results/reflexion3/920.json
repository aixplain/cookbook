Please provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, please note that we will need to calculate the total number of pets Larry has in the next steps. We already know that he has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and an unknown number of gerbils. We will need to add these numbers together to get the total number of pets.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Larry has 7 gerbils.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 5:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given that Larry has 3 cats, 9 dogs, 7 rabbits, 21 fish, and 7 gerbils.
