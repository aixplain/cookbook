Since Lana uses the remaining cups to brew cinnamon tea, we can subtract the number of cups used for cinnamon tea from the total number of cups to find the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of cups\ntotal_cups = 27\n\n# Define the number of cups used for cinnamon tea\ncinnamon_cups = 15\n\n# Calculate the number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea\nchamomile_and_mint_cups = total_cups - cinnamon_cups\n\nprint(chamomile_and_mint_cups)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of cups used for chamomile and mint tea is 12.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given that Lana has 27 cups of tea and she divides these into 3 rows.
