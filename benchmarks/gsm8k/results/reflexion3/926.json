    "question": "Colby loves going to the movies and every month his parents give him $150 to spend at the movies. Tickets for Fridays and Saturdays cost $10. Tickets for any other day cost $7. Popcorn costs $8 and boxes of candy cost $2. It is the last day of the month and it's a Friday. He wants to make sure he gets a popcorn and box of candy that night. How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?",

How many movies can he see if he already saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, 8 movies on other days, had 2 tubs of popcorn, and four boxes of candy that month?",
        "output": "To calculate the remaining amount for the month, we need to subtract the total amount spent so far from the monthly budget.\n\n```python\n# Define the monthly budget\nmonthly_budget = 150\n\n# Define the total amount spent so far\ntotal_spent_so_far = 130\n\n# Calculate the remaining amount for the month\nremaining_amount = monthly_budget - total_spent_so_far\n\n# Print the result\nprint(remaining_amount)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is 20.\n\nNext, we need to calculate the cost of a movie on Friday with popcorn and candy. The cost of a movie on Fridays and Saturdays is $10, the cost of a tub of popcorn is $8, and the cost of a box of candy is $2.\n\n```python\n# Define the cost per movie on Fridays and Saturdays\ncost_per_movie_on_friday_saturday = 10\n\n# Define the cost per tub of popcorn\ncost_per_tub_of_popcorn = 8\n\n# Define the cost per box of candy\ncost_per_box_of_candy = 2\n\n# Calculate the cost of a movie on Friday with popcorn and candy\ncost_of_movie_on_friday_with_popcorn_and_candy = cost_per_movie_on_friday_saturday + cost_per_tub_of_popcorn + cost_per_box_of_candy\n\n# Print the result\nprint(cost_of_movie_on_friday_with_popcorn_and_candy)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is 20.\n\nFinally, we need to calculate the number of movies Colby can see with the remaining amount.\n\n```python\n# Define the remaining amount for the month\nremaining_amount = 20\n\n# Define the cost of a movie on Friday with popcorn and candy\ncost_of_movie_on_friday_with_popcorn_and_candy = 20\n\n# Calculate the number of movies Colby can see with the remaining amount\nnumber_of_movies_colby_can_see = remaining_amount // cost_of_movie_on_friday_with_popcorn_and_candy\n\n# Print the result\nprint(number_of_movies_colby_can_see)\n```\n\nThe output of the code is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nColby can see 1 movie on the last day of the month, movies, 1.",
