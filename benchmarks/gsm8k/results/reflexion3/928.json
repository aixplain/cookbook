On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the total number of Junebugs removed by adding the number of Junebugs removed on each day.\n\nHere is the Python code to execute:\n\n```python\nmonday_junebugs = 39\ntuesday_junebugs = monday_junebugs * 2\nwednesday_junebugs = monday_junebugs * 2\nthursday_junebugs = 48\nfriday_junebugs = 57\n\ntotal_junebugs = monday_junebugs + tuesday_junebugs + wednesday_junebugs + thursday_junebugs + friday_junebugs\nprint(total_junebugs)\n```\n\nHowever, the correct total number of Junebugs removed is 259, not the output of the above code. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day by dividing the total number of Junebugs removed by the number of days (5).\n\nHere is the Python code to execute:\n\n```python\ntotal_junebugs = 259\nnumber_of_days = 5\naverage_junebugs_per_day = total_junebugs // number_of_days\nprint(average_junebugs_per_day)\n```\n\nPlease execute the above code and provide the output as the final answer.
