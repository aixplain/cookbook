Whoever spits their seeds the most total distance wins. They each get one watermelon. Zoey's has 40 seeds and she spits each one 10 feet. Sydney's has 35 she spits each one 12 feet. What is the average total distance spat?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total distance spat by Zoey, we need to multiply the number of seeds she has by the distance she spits each one. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nzoey_seeds = 40\nzoey_distance_per_seed = 10\n\n# Calculate total distance spat by Zoey\nzoey_total_distance = zoey_seeds * zoey_distance_per_seed\n\n# Print the result\nprint(zoey_total_distance)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total distance spat by Zoey. We will use this result in the next step to calculate the total distance spat by Sydney and then find the average total distance spat.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total distance spat by Zoey is 400.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the total distance spat by Sydney, we need to multiply the number of seeds she has by the distance she spits each one. We already know the total distance spat by Zoey from the previous step.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nsydney_seeds = 35\nsydney_distance_per_seed = 12\nzoey_total_distance = 400  # Result from previous step\n\n# Calculate total distance spat by Sydney\nsydney_total_distance = sydney_seeds * sydney_distance_per_seed\n\n# Print the result\nprint(sydney_total_distance)\n```\n\nThis will give us the total distance spat by Sydney. We will use this result in the next step to calculate the average total distance spat.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total distance spat by Sydney is 420.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the average of the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney, we need to add the total distances spat by both and divide by 2. We already know the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney from the previous steps.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, please execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define variables\nzoey_total_distance = 400  # Result from previous step\nsydney_total_distance = 420  # Result from previous step\n\n# Calculate the average of the total distances spat by Zoey and Sydney\naverage_total_distance = (zoey_total_distance + sydney_total_distance) / 2\n\n# Print the result\nprint(\"The average total distance spat is\", average_total_distance, \"feet.\")\n```\n\nThis will give us the average total distance spat by Zoey and Sydney.
