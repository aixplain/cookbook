        "output": "James gets 10 new CDs. Each CD cost $15. He gets them for 40% off. He decides he doesn't like 5 of them and sells them for $40. To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the difference between the total cost of the CDs and the amount he got back from selling 5 CDs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the CDs James bought. The original price of each CD is $15, and James gets a 40% discount on each CD. So, the discounted price of each CD is $15 * (1 - 0.4) = $9. The total cost of the CDs James bought is $9 * 10 = $90.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount James got back from selling 5 CDs. James sells each CD for $40, so the amount he got back from selling 5 CDs is $40 * 5 = $200.\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the total cost and the amount James got back. The difference is $200 - $90 = $110.\n\nSince James got back more money than he spent, he is not \"out\" any money. Instead, he has a profit of $110.\n\n[Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]: James gets 10 new CDs and sells 5 of them, dollars, 110",

To find out how much money James was out, we need to calculate the difference between the total cost of the CDs and the amount he got back from selling 5 CDs.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total cost of the CDs James bought. The original price of each CD is $15, and James gets a 40% discount on each CD. So, the discounted price of each CD is $15 * (1 - 0.4) = $9. The total cost of the CDs James bought is $9 * 10 = $90.\n\nNext, we calculate the amount James got back from selling 5 CDs. James sells each CD for $40, so the amount he got back from selling 5 CDs is $40 * 5 = $200.\n\nFinally, we calculate the difference between the total cost and the amount James got back. The difference is $200 - $90 = $110.\n\nSince James got back more money than he spent, he is not \"out\" any money. Instead, he has a profit of $110.\n\n[Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]: James gets 10 new CDs and sells 5 of them, dollars, 110",
