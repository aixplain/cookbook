The total points scored by the team is 45.\n\nIn the previous steps, we defined the points scored by Bahati in terms of A as A + 20, the points scored by Dinar in terms of A as (A + 20) - 10, and the total points scored by the team as 3A + 30. We also solved for A and found that A = 5. We also calculated the points scored by Bahati and found that it is 25 points. We also calculated the points scored by Dinar and found that it is 15 points.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, let's define the points scored by Azibo and provide the final answer in the required format.\n\n```python\n# Define the points scored by Bahati in terms of A\ndef bahati_points(A):\n    return A + 20\n\n# Define the points scored by Dinar in terms of A\ndef dinar_points(A):\n    return (A + 20) - 10\n\n# Define the total points scored by the team\ndef total_points(A):\n    return A + (A + 20) + ((A + 20) - 10)\n\n# Calculate the points scored by Azibo\ndef calculate_azibo_points():\n    A = 5\n    return A\n\n# Print the explanation\nprint(\"Explanation: Azibo scored\", calculate_azibo_points(), \"points.\")\n\n# Print the unit\nprint(\"Unit: points\")\n\n# Print the final answer\nprint(\"Final answer:\", [calculate_azibo_points()])\n```\n\nPlease execute the above code and provide the output in the required format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].",
