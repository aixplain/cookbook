        "output": "The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to find the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks and subtract it from the total capacity of the hospital.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of beds already occupied, which is 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. This is equal to 200.0 beds.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks by multiplying the number of patients admitted per day (50) by the number of days in 2 weeks (14). This is equal to 700 patients.\n\nThen, we add the number of beds already occupied (200.0) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks. This is equal to 900.0 beds.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks (900.0) from the total capacity of the hospital (1000) to get the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks. This is equal to 100 beds.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n['Number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks', 'beds', 100]",

To calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks, we need to find the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks and subtract it from the total capacity of the hospital.\n\nFirst, we calculate the number of beds already occupied, which is 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital. This is equal to 200.0 beds.\n\nNext, we calculate the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks by multiplying the number of patients admitted per day (50) by the number of days in 2 weeks (14). This is equal to 700 patients.\n\nThen, we add the number of beds already occupied (200.0) to the total number of patients admitted in 2 weeks (700) to get the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks. This is equal to 900.0 beds.\n\nFinally, we subtract the total number of beds occupied after 2 weeks (900.0) from the total capacity of the hospital (1000) to get the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks. This is equal to 100 beds.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n['Number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks', 'beds', 100]",
