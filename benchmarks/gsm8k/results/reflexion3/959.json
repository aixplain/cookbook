We know that Jason carried 2 balls, Jeffrey carried 1 ball, and Jordan carried 4 balls.\n\nUsing the information provided, we can write a Python code to calculate the total number of balls by adding the number of balls each boy carried.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate the total number of balls:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of balls each boy carried\njason_balls = 2\njeffrey_balls = 1\njordan_balls = 4\n\n# Calculate the total number of balls\ntotal_balls = jason_balls + jeffrey_balls + jordan_balls\n\n# Print the total number of balls\nprint(total_balls)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the next intermediate step.\n\nAlso, please provide the explanation as \"The coach brought one bag filled with basketballs to practice and dumped them all out onto the gym floor before practice began.
