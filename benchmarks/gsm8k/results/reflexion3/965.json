    "question": "A bird decides to leave her summer home in the north and travel to her winter home in the south.  To make the journey, the bird leaves her home flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?",

To make the journey, the bird leaves her home flying in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.  Then, the bird turns direction and flies towards the north for 2 hours are a speed of 18 miles per hour.  Finally, the bird changes direction and flies toward the south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour before landing at her southern home.  What is the distance, in miles, between the bird's northern and the southern homes?",
