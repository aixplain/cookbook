In the previous step, we calculated that Greta had a total of 66 brownies. During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, you can convert this amount to a numerical value and subtract it from the total number of brownies.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of brownies\ntotal_brownies = 66\n\n# Define the number of brownies eaten during the party\nbrownies_eaten = 1.5 * 12  # 1 1/2 dozen\n\n# Calculate the number of brownies left over\nbrownies_left = total_brownies - brownies_eaten\n\n# Print the number of brownies left over\nprint(brownies_left)\n```\n\nPlease execute this command and provide the output as the next intermediate step.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'Greta had 48 brownies left over after the party.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are assigned to format the final answer as [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer].\n\nTo do this, you need to use the results from the previous steps.
