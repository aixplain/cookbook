If the phone price is $600 how much did he pay for them all?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where John decides to buy new phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. Each phone after the first 2 is half price. If the phone price is $600, we need to calculate the number of phones at full price and half price.\n\nTo do this, we know that John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife, which makes a total of 4 people. Since the first 2 phones are at full price, and the rest are at half price, we can calculate the number of phones at full price and half price.\n\nPlease use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of phones\ntotal_phones = 4\n\n# Define the number of phones at full price\nfull_price_phones = 2\n\n# Calculate the number of phones at half price\nhalf_price_phones = total_phones - full_price_phones\n\nprint(\"Number of phones at full price:\", full_price_phones)\nprint(\"Number of phones at half price:\", half_price_phones)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the number of phones at full price and half price.

If the phone price is $600, we need to calculate the total cost of the phones.\n\nIn the previous step, we calculated the number of phones at full price and half price. We found that there are 2 phones at full price and 2 phones at half price.\n\nTo calculate the total cost of the phones, we can use the following information:\n\n- The price of a phone at full price is $600.\n- The price of a phone at half price is $600 / 2 = $300.\n\nWe can use the python_repl tool to execute the following Python code:\n\n```python\n# Define the price of a phone at full price\nfull_price = 600\n\n# Define the number of phones at full price\nfull_price_phones = 2\n\n# Define the number of phones at half price\nhalf_price_phones = 2\n\n# Calculate the price of a phone at half price\nhalf_price = full_price / 2\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the phones at full price\ntotal_full_price_cost = full_price * full_price_phones\n\n# Calculate the total cost of the phones at half price\ntotal_half_price_cost = half_price * half_price_phones\n\n# Calculate the total cost of all phones\ntotal_cost = total_full_price_cost + total_half_price_cost\n\nprint(\"Total cost of the phones: $\", total_cost)\n```\n\nThis code will calculate the total cost of the phones.
