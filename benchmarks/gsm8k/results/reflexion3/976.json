On Saturday, he sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie, than on Sunday. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday and 15 boxes of apple pie. If the gingerbread cost $6 and the apple pie cost $15, how much did Sunny earn for two days?\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday, we need to use the information provided in the problem. We know that on Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday. Let's denote the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday as `saturday_gingerbread`.\n\nSince we don't have the exact value of `saturday_gingerbread`, we will represent it as a variable for now.\n\nPlease execute the following code to define the variable:\n\n```python\n# Define the variable for the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday\nsaturday_gingerbread = None\n```\n\nWe will come back to this variable later when we have more information. For now, let's move on to the next step.\n\nPlease confirm that the variable has been defined successfully.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The variable `saturday_gingerbread` has been defined successfully with a value of `None`.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday, we need to use the information provided in the problem.

We need to find the actual value of `saturday_gingerbread` first.\n\nLet's use the information that on Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread. We can update the value of `saturday_gingerbread` with this information.\n\nPlease execute the following code to update the value of `saturday_gingerbread` and calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday:\n\n```python\n# Update the value of saturday_gingerbread\nsaturday_gingerbread = 10\n\n# Calculate the number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday\nsunday_gingerbread = saturday_gingerbread + 5\n\n# Print the value of sunday_gingerbread\nprint(sunday_gingerbread)\n```\n\nPlease confirm that the value of `sunday_gingerbread` has been calculated successfully.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The value of `sunday_gingerbread` has been calculated successfully and is 15.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 3:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nTo calculate the number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday, we need to use the information provided in the problem.
