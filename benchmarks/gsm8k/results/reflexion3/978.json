The price of the blue car is given as $100, and the discount amount was calculated in the previous step as 40.0.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to calculate the price of the red car.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the price of the blue car\nblue_car_price = 100\n\n# Define the discount amount\ndiscount = 40.0\n\n# Calculate the price of the red car (blue car price - discount)\nred_car_price = blue_car_price - discount\n\n# Print the price of the red car\nprint(red_car_price)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the price of the red car.\n\nAlso, we need to calculate the total cost of both cars. To do this, we need to add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Calculate the total cost of both cars (blue car price + red car price)\ntotal_cost = blue_car_price + red_car_price\n\n# Print the total cost of both cars\nprint(total_cost)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the total cost of both cars.\n\nFinally, we need to provide the answer in the required format: [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer]. \n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```python\n# Define the explanation\nexplanation = \"The blue car costs $100 and the red car costs \" + str(red_car_price) + \". The total cost of both cars is \" + str(total_cost) + \".\"\n\n# Define the unit\nunit = \"dollars\"\n\n# Define the final answer\nfinal_answer = int(total_cost)\n\n# Print the answer in the required format\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```\n\nPlease execute this code and provide the output as the final answer.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'[\"The blue car costs $100 and the red car costs 60.
