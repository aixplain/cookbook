They have a 30-pound bag of soil and want to plant roses, carnations, and sunflowers. Each rose needs 1 pound of soil, each carnation needs 1.5 pounds, and each sunflower needs 3 pounds. They plan to plant 4 sunflowers and 10 carnations.\n\nIn the previous steps, you calculated that the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers is 12 pounds, the total amount of soil used by the carnations is 15.0 pounds, the total amount of soil used by the sunflowers and carnations is 27.0 pounds, the amount of soil left for the roses is 3.0 pounds, and the number of roses that can be planted is 3 roses.\n\nYour task is to return the answer as an [Explanation,unit,final answer as an integer]. \n\nUsing the python_repl tool, write a Python command to return the answer in the required format.\n\nFor example, you can use the following command:\n\n```python\nexplanation = \"Artemis and her father can plant 3 roses with the remaining soil.\"\nunit = \"roses\"\nfinal_answer = 3\nprint([explanation, unit, final_answer])\n```",
