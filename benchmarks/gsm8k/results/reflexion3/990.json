We also know that it was on low for 3 hours.\n\nUsing the python_repl tool, calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low by multiplying the cooling rate by the number of hours it was on low.\n\nHere's the Python code to calculate this:\n\n```python\n# Define the cooling rate when the air conditioner is on low\ncooling_rate_low = 2  # degrees per hour\n\n# Define the number of hours the air conditioner was on low\nhours_low = 3\n\n# Calculate the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low\ntemperature_change_low = cooling_rate_low * hours_low\n\nprint(temperature_change_low)\n```\n\nPlease execute this code using the python_repl tool and provide the output as the temperature change when the air conditioner was on low.'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The temperature change when the air conditioner was on low is 6 degrees.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are given a problem where an air conditioner cools a room at different rates depending on its setting.
