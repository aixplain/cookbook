Each guest brought a plate of 15 cookies. The bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church next door as a thank you for helping in the wedding reception. If each person in the church next door got 15 cookies, how many people were in the church next door?\nFEEDBACK: The response should be in the format [Explanation, unit, final answer as an integer] as requested in the assignment. The worker should have executed the python command and returned the result of the print statement, which is [The number of people in the church next door is, 'people', 50].\n\nINTERMEDIATE STEPS:\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 1:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are assigned to calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests. \n\nTo do this, you need to multiply the number of guests by the number of cookies each guest brought. \n\nThe number of guests is 100 and the number of cookies each guest brought is 15.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of guests and the number of cookies each guest brought\nguests = 100\ncookies_per_guest = 15\n\n# Calculate the total number of cookies brought by the guests\ntotal_cookies = guests * cookies_per_guest\n\n# Print the total number of cookies\nprint(total_cookies)\n```'\nWORKER RESPONSE:\n'The total number of cookies brought by the guests is 1500.'\n--------------------\n\n***INTERMEDIATE STEP 2:***\nWORKER: Python Code Executor\nWORKER INPUT:\n'ASSIGNMENT:\n\nYou are assigned to calculate the number of cookies given to the church.\n\nTo do this, you need to divide the total number of cookies brought by the guests by 2, since the bride decided to give 1/2 of the cookies to the church.\n\nThe total number of cookies brought by the guests is 1500.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the total number of cookies brought by the guests\ntotal_cookies = 1500\n\n# Calculate the number of cookies given to the church\ncookies_given_to_church = total_cookies / 2\n\n# Print the number of cookies given to the church\nprint(cookies_given_to_church)\n```'\nWORKER

calculate the number of people in the church next door.\n\nTo do this, you need to divide the number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies each person in the church received.\n\nThe number of cookies given to the church is 750.0 and the number of cookies each person received is 15.\n\nUse the python_repl tool to execute the following python command:\n\n```python\n# Define the number of cookies given to the church and the number of cookies each person received\ncookies_given_to_church = 750.0\ncookies_per_person = 15\n\n# Calculate the number of people in the church next
