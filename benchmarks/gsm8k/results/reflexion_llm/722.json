    "question": "Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine Ron $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if he fixes it himself. Ron will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money does Ron save by fixing the pothole?",
