If the farmer and the truck driver put in a 6 hour day, how many bales of hay are left in the field?",
        "output": "The farmer and the truck driver worked for 6 hours. The farmer made 5 bales per hour, so they made 5 * 6 = 30 bales. The truck picked up 3 bales per hour, so they picked up 3 * 6 = 18 bales. Therefore, there are 30 - 18 = 12 bales of hay left in the field.",
