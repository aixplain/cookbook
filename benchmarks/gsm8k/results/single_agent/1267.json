        "output": "The farm has 10 2-legged animals and 15 4-legged animals. To find the total number of pairs of animal legs, we need to calculate the total number of legs first. 10 2-legged animals have 10 x 2 = 20 legs. 15 4-legged animals have 15 x 4 = 60 legs. The total number of legs is 20 + 60 = 80. Since each pair has 2 legs, the total number of pairs of animal legs is 80 / 2 = 40.",
