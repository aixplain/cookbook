        "output": "To find the cost of a pen, we need to add the cost of a pencil and an eraser. The pencil costs $1.20 and the eraser costs $0.30, so the pen costs $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50. To find the cost of 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8. So, 8 pens will cost $1.50 * 8 = $12.00. The answer is 12.",
