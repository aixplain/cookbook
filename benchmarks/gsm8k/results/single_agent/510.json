    "question": "For a New Year's resolution, Andy wants to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday, which is July 19th. Today is December 31st. If Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, how much of a calorie deficit (net amount of calories burned vs. calories consumed) does he need each day to reach his goal?",

        "output": "To calculate the calorie deficit needed per day, we need to calculate the total number of days between December 31st and July 19th. Then we can divide the total calories needed to be burned (30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb) by the total number of days. The total calories needed to be burned is 30 * 3500 = 105000. The total number of days between December 31st and July 19th is 200. The calorie deficit needed per day is 105000 / 200 = 525.",
