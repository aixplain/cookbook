        "output": "The cost per pump is 1200 cents, but since Jackie only uses 1 pump per wash, and the original amount of washes is 120, the number of pumps in the bottle is 240. So the cost per wash is 1200 / 240 = 5 cents per wash, but the question asks for the cost per pump, which is 1200 / 240 = 5 cents per pump.",
