    "question": "Helga was the fastest clog dancer in all of Slovenia. With both hands at her sides, she could tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute, while simultaneously tapping her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute.  When she raised her arms, her tap rate slowed down to 200 taps per minute with each foot.  If she dances a total of 5 minutes, with her arms raised during only 2 of those minutes, what would be the combined total number of times that she taps both of her feet?",
