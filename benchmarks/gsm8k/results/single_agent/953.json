    "question": "Kim sleepwalks, to monitor her sleeping hours, she installs a camera in her room. Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m. She is a sleepwalker. One day, after reviewing the cameras, she finds that she woke up that day and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am.  Also, that day she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. How many minutes did she sleep on her bed that day?",

        "output": "To find the total number of minutes Kim slept on her bed, we need to calculate the time she slept before waking up at 2:15 am and the time she slept after returning to bed at 2:38 am. We also need to consider that she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual. Let's break it down: Kim slept from 10:00 PM to 2:15 AM which is 4 hours and 15 minutes = 255 minutes. She then woke up and was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am which is 23 minutes. After that, she slept from 2:38 am to 5:55 am which is 3 hours and 17 minutes = 197 minutes. So the total number of minutes she slept on her bed is 255 + 197 = 452 minutes.",
