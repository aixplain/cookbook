        "✅ Secure tool integration - Permissioned access to APIs and services with scoped credentials and runtime enforcement\n",
        "✅ Governance and observability - End-to-end traceability of decisions, policy enforcement, audit trails, and structured logs\n",

        "Traditional software is built on rules, determinism, and control.\n",

        "🔁 Non-determinism - Same input, different output—depending on model context, retrievals, or tool states.\n",
        "➕ Lets agents adapt responses to real-time context—enabling hyper-personalized decisions at scale.\n",

        "🧠 Opaque reasoning chains - Decisions happen inside models, not code. Planning is dynamic, not traceable.\n",
        "➕ Unlocks complex, emergent behavior—so systems can handle edge cases without manual rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "🎛 Execution variability - Outcome depends on everything: tools, APIs, data freshness, model latency.\n",

        "\n",
        "🧪 Continuous evaluation - Static unit tests won’t cut it. You need runtime checks for hallucination, groundedness, and cost.\n",
        "➕ Flags hallucinations and cost spikes in real time—so issues are caught before users ever see them.\n",
