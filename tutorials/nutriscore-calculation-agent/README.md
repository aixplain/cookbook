 # Nutri-Score Calculation Agent

The Nutri-Score Calculation Agent is designed to determine the Nutri-Score of a food item based on its nutritional content. The Nutri-Score is a standardized 5-color rating system that helps consumers quickly assess the nutritional quality of food products. It ranges from A (healthiest) to E (least healthy), considering both positive and negative nutritional factors.

This agent ensures an accurate Nutri-Score calculation by either:
- Manually collecting nutritional values from user input.
- Using OCR to extract macronutrients from images of nutrition labels.
